Year after year, more than $ 100 billion is donated to charities from European and American companies. There are several good reasons for this: It strengthens work ethic and job satisfaction among existing employees, it helps to attract qualified new employees, it increases brand value, it provides effective marketing, and it is an easy CSR initiative. From these $ 100 billion, more than 20%(!) goes to administration, sales and marketing, meaning than more than $ 20 billion is used to run NGOs. Still, as a company you have very little knowledge about how the donation is managed, who you benefit from and how.

Ultimately this results in companies taking on massive risks if you choose to donate to charity, because what if the donation is not managed as you expect? 

Founded in 2021, Contribe is on a mission to bring clarity, transparency and efficiency to the world of donation management. Ultimately, we give businesses and foundations all around the globe the ability to safely communicate their efforts and really benefit from their donations, as we eliminate all risks of your donation not being managed as stated in reports etc. Also, we give NGO’s more time and funds for the work that actually matters - The charitable work, and thereby doing our part to speed up the protection of humans and nature and awareness of the SDG’s.

At Contribe we are building the first ever platform to fully manage the partnerships between businesses and NGO’s, helping the parties connect and collaborate, communicate their efforts with supreme accuracy and free time to focus on creating value instead of focusing on tiresome and obsolete administrative practices. We are going to totally redefine the way donations are made, handled and communicated!

The julegenser.no project is simply a result of our very first ugly christmas sweater love affair!

After a visit to Canada in 2012, two sumptuous, LED flashing ugly christmas sweaters came with us home to winter Oslo, Norway. The sweaters evoked this childlike happiness over the Christmas celebration, both in us and in everyone else when we wore them to Christmas parties and we noticed that we wanted more of this feeling. We simply wanted more of such sweaters!

It was easier said than done in 2012. But, if you do not find what you are looking for, you can make it yourself...so then we did it. Although it took its time.

With our brand 'Krismis' https://krismis.com, we want to share this sparkling, warm Christmas feeling with you. This way you can also have the Christmas atmosphere in your wardrobe all year round, and always have something to wear at the Christmas party, not matter what. We simply love Christmas sweaters! That is why we do not compromise on quality.

We wish you a Merry Christmas, and remember that the most important message of Christmas is love.

Jutebar Denmark Aps working with 3 among 17 FN world goals. Poverty alleviation and eco-friendly living goals are the most two common goals in which jute bar Denmark is working right now. As we are directly sourced and produced the product from a rural area in Bangladesh, they are mostly poor people. They do not have the skills to sale their product in the international market. They do not have the ability to broaden their capacity as well. Jutebar Denmark continuously working on build up their capacities and capabilities by maintaining quality which is suitable for the Nordic market. Mckinsey and company report of 2019 said that 99% of danish people worried about plastic and plastic-based material. They said the danish government should do something about the alternative of plastic. So Jutebar Denmark is working on the solution already. As jute is totally 100% organic fibre. No chemicals and pesticide can be used to grow jute. The report of Mckinsey and company also mentioned that 85% of danish people worried about ocean waste which is mostly plastic. So Jute can be the solution to this problem as well. As jute can help the land to become more fertile. Wastage of jute or jute made products can be used for landfill. As a part of recycling, jute can be recycled and make home textile which can contribute to the danish economy as well. Jutebar Denmark already thinking to establish recycle production in either Denmark or Poland so that the supply chain process will be shorter. All in all Jutebar Denmark currently working on making a bridge between the rural farmer of Bangladesh and Nordic buyer especially in the B2B market.
Jutebar is a scalable business not a small business. We have a great team of production, supply chain management, quality management and a dedicated marketing team. We are working basically with jute and jute made products and Bangladesh is the land of jute as more than 60% of jute in the world produce in Bangladesh. We are continuously working and investing in IT so that our customer can easily get our product from farmer to end user. In future, we can probably use blockchain technology in Liew of issuing a letter of credit to our local bank. Our marketing policy is quite different from the traditional marketing system. We are doing solution-based marketing. That’s why we are offering our customers a customized design and packaging system. Besides all of the above, we have great suppliers also. We are much more confident to scale our business in Europe and all over the world in near future. But our current focused market area is Nordic.
Besides Jute and Jute made products Jutebar Denmark also going to source other biodegradable items as well. Such as palm leaf made biodegradable plates, bowl, spoon. As single-use of plastic and plastic made plates, glass, bowls are going to be banned in Denmark and the Nordic area.JuteBar Denmark’s mission is to replace the plastic item with a biodegradable item from Bangladesh. Jutebar Denmark following the Bangladesh model here because the Bangladesh government banned plastic since 2002. So Jutebar Denmark going to adapt the system over here in Denmark.

Sseguku,Denmark,sseguku.org,2017,1-10,Fintech,Marketplace,Bootstrapping,"Sseguku has created a platform that can connect Danish lenders with small businesses in Uganda to create financial inclusion for these companies with the use of cloud-based technologies and mobile money.

What: 
The vast majority of small businesses in Uganda do not have the opportunity to borrow from the bank for the establishment and operation of their business. Therefore, the opportunities for development and employment that are necessary to create good living conditions in the country are not created. Microloans are a proven method to remedy this problem. There are others than Sseguku that provide microloans in Uganda, but the need is far greater than the supply.

In Denmark, there are opportunities to make contributions to aid organizations and also opportunities to invest sustainably through investment associations, but no other options than Sseguku to provide loans to specific companies and with the opportunity for returns to the lender.

Sseguku solves the challenges both in Uganda and in Denmark by establishing a peer-to-peer lending platform where Danish lenders can help finance loans to specific companies identified and assessed by Sseguku's subsidiary in Uganda. The subsidiary in Uganda also helps to manage the repayments from the borrowers and with debt recovery.
There are no other companies in Denmark with the same offer for Danish lenders. Sseguku has permission from the Danish FSA in accordance with the Payments Act, §51.

How?
Sseguku is established, registered and has the necessary permits in both Denmark and Uganda. In Uganda, Sseguku is represented by its Ugandan subsidiary.
Sseguku has developed an integrated platform based on cloud technology that includes both the website that lenders use for lending and for information and the management solution used by Sseguku's subsidiary in Uganda to set up loans and manage repayments. The administration solution integrates with the mobile companies' mobile money platforms and with Sseguku's bank accounts.

Sseguku has established a financial infrastructure that enables transfers between bank accounts in Denmark and in Uganda, and transfers in Uganda between the bank and the borrowers' mobile money.

Sseguku created a network in Uganda in collaboration with an accountant, a lawyer and a number of actors in microfinance and aid organizations. Among other things, Sseguku, in collaboration with DanChurchAid (DCA), has investigated the possibilities of utilizing Sseguku's platform in connection with offering microloans to refugees in camps run by DCA.

Why?
The two founders: Kiyingi Yekosofaati and Hans Henrik Hammerum have a long-standing friendship that stretches back to the end of the last century. They have both, though in different ways, been deeply involved in microfinance and in developing countries in Africa. Kiyingi through employment in different microfinance institutions in Uganda and Hans Henrik through extensive investments in microloans through a previously similar platform, MyC4, which has existed in Denmark until 2014. Both have also been involved in development activities run by NGOs. Both are driven by a strong will to create financial inclusion and opportunities for low-income groups in Uganda and elsewhere it has value.

When circumstances made it possible at the beginning of 2017, the interest gained concrete content and Sseguku was registered first in Denmark and then in Uganda.

The most important activity since then has been to obtain permission from the Danish FSA to operate the website aimed at Danish lenders.

The first loans were given in November 2018 with funds from the founders and their network and the organization in Uganda has provided loans since with the funds that have been available.

The platform is not yet immediately ready to receive contributions from lenders, as some development activities are still pending. We anticipate that the launch and marketing of the platform may begin in early 2021.

BACKGROUND
Tea is the most consumed beverage in the world after water.
The tea industry is a hundreds of year old colonial business. Founded on exploitation and  slavery. 
99% of all tea in the world is produced on plantages. On a plantage you will nerver find biological diversity but you will find a lot of pesticides, fertilizers and huge amount of watering.

We have a very good marketing concept to run the CAC test with. 
The Team are all experienced marketeers and have a very positive anticipation on what the campaign shall do for the brand regarding recognition and sales.

We aim for A-Series Q3/Q€- 2022 to launch in Germany and Poland Q1-2023. Our platform is prepared (translated) , the domains and registrations in place for EU, legal, distribution and a strong communications concept etc is ready for launch.

1. Countless Africans lost money because they trusted someone in Africa to conduct a financial transaction or local project on their behalf and got abused. 
2. Current E-commerce marketplaces focusing on Africa do not necessarily take into account the diaspora. 
3. They do not take into account the consumer to consumer (C2C) aspect as well as the micro and/or informal ecosystems.
4. No easy way exists to find trustworthy partners and suppliers in Africa.
5. Weak business digitization in general and, in particular, lack of several strong E-commerce marketplaces for Africa.

The solution :
Therefore we created  dadorg.com. First to solve the problem of Africans from the diaspora (outside the continent of Africa) wishing to build houses, buy land or make similar personal projects in Africa and who could not find anyone trustworthy enough to carry these projects out with.

The idea slowly moved towards all types of projects and finally towards all kinds of products and services, to become an E-commerce marketplace geared towards the African diaspora and Africa in general without ignoring the global inherent nature of any E-commerce platform.

We have the resources we need, but until now there has been no sustainable way to tackle this challenge.Whether it's €5 or €5.000, you support a local entrepreneur gain financial independence, while creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and forming cross-culture alliances 

Hi there!We are REstart Refugees, but we go by REstart most of the time. We are a start up social enterprise  with a diverse and international team, that consists as much of a community as it does a business. During a fellowship with the UnSchool in Berlin, 2016, our founder realized the potential that a local crowdfunding platform had to support countless talented and experienced refugees who are determined to contribute to their host countries, but don't have a way to access start up funding. What's more, there was a huge gap between refugees and civil society, making it even more difficult to work together. It was then that the idea of REstart -- the world's first local crowdfunding platform specifically for refugees -- was born. Since then we have grown to a team of more than 28 volunteers, including a board of advisors, web team, development, marketing &amp; communications, and a growing network  across Denmark and Europe, and the Middle East. While hundreds of crowdfunding platforms already exist, we take pride in being local and providing our clients with the support throughout the start up journey. Our profits aren't just profits, they find our operations, including the on-going support of our clients. While our primary goal is mission-based, we also strive to find financial sustainability because you shouldn't have to choose between making an impact and making a living.We thrive on authentic connections within the team and with our clients and backers, and feel confident that together we can take an active role in our shared future, one company at a time.

Det er her vi kommer ind i billedet.

At Africa Reframed we connect a community of African photographers to the world’s leading companies and organizations to create and promote captivating imagery and bespoke projects that propel new storytelling from the African continent.

Imagery in the Africa Reframed imagebank has been used by the worlds leading organizations such as:
Gates Foundation, UN, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, Ernst & Young, Spotify, NBC, Yahoo, Sitecore, Exxon, Cambridge University Press, Hearst, Condé Nast, Lloyds bank, Europe- an Investment Bank, Shell, AOL, ABC, NEC, CNBC, KPMG, Discovery, VISA, Deloitte, Accenture, Ogilvy, UPS, Viacom, Pearson, Barclays, BBC, Axel Springer, British Council, M&C Saatchi, ASUS, Del Monte, Time inc., RTL, Virgin, McKinsey, Airtel, Guardian, Uber, Orange, 3M, HSBC, Samsung, The World Bank and many more.

We are looking for investors sharing our vision of Africa Reframed as a value-driven, profitable business that strives to alter the global community’s perception of the African continent while also building sustainable job opportunities for photographers across Africa.

Alongside its sister organization, Commerce & Culture, Africa Reframed has managed an array of long-term projects with leading contemporary visual artists globally and organized photo exhibitions with more than 100.000 paying visitors across 3 continents. Among these, the largest exhibition to date with African photography in northern Europe.

SDGs:

Quality education and decent work and economic growth, SDGs 4 and 8, are an integrated part of the Africa Reframed business model. When the United Nations In 2015 was launching the SDGs with Project Everyone, they did so with a campaign to share the global goals with 7 billion people in 7 days. This happened via global broadcasts, outdoor advertising campaigns, cinema ads, mobile partnerships, and more. Because of the above, Images from our program were among the officially chosen for the campaign and were singled out by the global campaign team as good education and economic growth in action.

Misson:

Most of the imagery we encounter from the African continent tends to either depict the beautiful scenery and wildlife or scenes of poverty, war, and desperation. While these indeed are bona fide aspects and challenges, Africa is also a continent characterized by immense growth, varied opportunities, and not least, change. The mission of Africa Reframed is to capture and contribute to the spurring of this change by a visual reframing of the continent. A reframing that reflects African enterprise, innovation, and everyday life. Africa Reframed exists to create and promote this new imagery in the belief that by changing the visuals, we can help change the conversation. Thus an inherent part of Africa Reframed’s DNA, which is also mirrored in the name of the company, is to be a catalyst for the way the world looks at the African continent.

The wish to illustrate the real Africa and thus to spur optimism and hope around its future makes the company strongly value-driven, and it is believed that such a shared view will help bind contributors, clients, and other stakeholders close together.

In 2020 Africa Reframed received an investment from Innovation fund Denmark and was selected as a finalist for the SDG Tech Award.

While the cost of repair service is high, the number of service providers is also very limited and considering all thrift solutions, the majority of secondhand materials are still going to Lindfield while it can be used as material. 
And as the last leg of this international picture,  today's available solutions are mostly based on recruiting service providers instead of giving them the opportunity to be the owner of their business which make the sustainability of those models strictly dependent on the those business owners instead of relying on the owners of the practical knowledge and craft.

Repasdo is a marketplace for unique, creative services of textile and relevant secondhand materials. It’s home to people providing special, extraordinary services and products, from repaired pieces to handcrafted and vintage treasures.
While today’s main trend is into secondhand shopping online solutions, Repasdo focus is to provide possibility to create ‘added value’ instead of pure thrift store business model. 
By providing business and market opportunity (online store + learning, low cost material & equipment) to potential service providers, secondhand textile can be repaired or be used as raw material for new product (in as many different ways as service providers can manage to come up with).
Repasdo Platform (as the first in its market) is to provide a platform for creating jobs, micro and small businesses (own by service providers) while providing practical learning and access to different type of secondhand textile as material and online stores as places for those businesses to thrive. 
We are three co-founders with background in strategic business and organizational development, application and software development, and fashion design and learning. In addition two of us have long years of experience in humanitarian aid organizations and woman empowering programs. 

We have strong believe in sustainability and circularity not in relation with  of product and service, but as the sole practical concept and business model

This causes people to delay, skip or forgo care for lack of money, or to choose between healthcare and food or education. The consequences are drastic and well documented. 
The traditional insurance and community based health financing solution have proven ineffective. Only about 5% of the population is covered, mainly because of high prices, lack of trust and the low reach of their agent based models.

Through RightHair we give women all over the world an opportunity to start their own businesses and be financially independent. We do this by creating a software platform to connect freelancers, retailers and hairdressers to their customers. And we top that off with a “skill share” community for education. 

People with curls and afro textured hair are excluded from offers and services in today's beauty industry. Also, financial abuse is one of the main reasons why women are unable to leave relationships, worldwide. These problems contribute to discrimination in society, that women with minority backgrounds end up outside society and this makes the poor poorer. Women of color are excluded from many of the existing offers worldwide.

RightHair solves these problems by creating a market platform where all services and products meet. So that people with curly and afro textured hair always can find something in their area. We also solve women's job and financial challenges around the world by offering a platform on which they can sell their products and services. Here they also get the opportunity to take courses, learn how to start and build a business and collaborate with partners outside their network.

RightHair was founded by Lalla Coulibaly and Olimata Jeng who both grew up in Norway with roots from Africa. Due to the lack of offers for themselves and their community, the ladies each started their own platforms. Over the past 5 years, Krølltopp.no and Norwegian Naturals have grown into Norway's largest platforms for curly and afro textured hair with a total of 12,000 monthly users. now the ladies have teamed up to start RightHair as the question they get the most on their platforms is “where can I get my hair cut” and “where can I find products?''. Both ladies want to put time and energy into something that can contribute to women's opportunities and living conditions. This desire comes from their own experience as minority women in Norway with African roots.

We solve this with an autonomous drone flying over the fields, equipped with speakers. Emitting special sounds that birds recognize as danger, we will push them out of the crops, back to natural areas where they can feed without conflict. A landing platform laying on the field will recharge and shelter the drone, allowing the whole system to operate autonomously. Furthermore, the user will be able to check the real time status and modify the settings from our mobile app!

Additionally, in the future we aim to equip special cameras on the bottom of the drone to collect high quality periodical images for crop monitoring practices. This will lead to save time and resources for the farmer, such as tons of chemical pesticides thrown to the field without knowledge.

Right now, we put all our time and effort into creating sustainable stock and fermented flavour enhancers.

We aim to develop a broad portfolio of products that will

Always with a focus on taste and sustainability.

In 6 months we have developed and launch four products based on excess produce, without seeking any financing. The products are sold in 55 supermarkets (Irma, SuperBrugsen, Meyers Deli etc),  at Nemlig.com and in food service. 

The products are developed with one thing in mind: ""How can we make taste from waste?"". 

These are the six products:

1) Organic Umami Drops, Chicken: Made from egglaying chickens in excess from egg production. The chickens usually are used for biogas. We are changing this.

2) Organic Umami Drops, Mushroom: Made of excess faulty mushrooms from mushroom production. Instead of them going to waste, we create delicious vegan umami from them.

3)  Organic Chicken Stock: Made from egglaying chickens in excess from egg production. The chickens usually are used for biogas. We are changing this.

4) Shellfish Stock: Made from some of the 12 billion shore crabs in the Danish seas. Shore crabs are a massive problem for fishermen and they harm marine ecosystems.

5) Organic Vegetable Stock: Made from nordic seaweed and fragments of dried mushrooms. Seaweed is considered as one of the most overseen and essential resources of future
food.

We are developing new waste management solution by using biotechnology for convertion of  organic waste like food waste, into protein and organic fertilizer. 

The traditional waste management solutions like landfill, composting, biogas production or incineration are all leading to green house gas emission and the economic value of the end product is low or negative. The greenhouse gas Methane is a 72 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbondioxide, and  organic waste on landfills are responsible for 11 % of Methane emission.

The global aquaculture industry is a great source for healthy food and has been in strong annual growth for decades, but in order to continue growing it is crucial to find new sources for feed,in particular protein and omega-3 oils. The supply of traditional feed sources like fish meal and soy are limited, and there are environmental conserns to increase soy production.

In Greentech Innovators we are now investing in a pilot plant for fermentation of food waste into Single cell protein and organic fertilizer in Bergen. We have a dedicated team, and the second largest waste management company in Norway,BIR ,as partner.

We are now searching for investors to finalize the pilot palnt and scale up the production. If you are looking for investment in a company that strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase production of food for the growing population Greentech Innovators is a good choice.

The demand for locally produced, sustainable food is increasing. Despite this, small-scale vegetable producers struggle to make an income.  Predictable supply is essential to make efficient use of available market channels for direct to consumer sales, and a good plan is a key prerequisite to achieve this. The Digital Gardener aims to help small scale producers achieve the needed predictability by making it easy to create and maintain a good plan, and by helping them keep on top of work to be done throughout the growing season.

The interest in gardening and homesteading has also surged during the corona crisis.  Unfortunately, many aspiring home gardeners lack the needed growing competence to succeed with their gardening projects.  Ambitious homesteaders face similar challenges as professional growers, as they need a good plan to ensure that they can harvest fresh produce for their family throughout the season. The Digital Gardener aims to help all growers succeed with their gardening projects, and will enable them to share information and experience to help and inspire others to succeed as well.

Nära & Naturlig,Sweden,naraochnaturlig.se,2020,1-10,Energy & Greentech,B2B,Bootstrapping,"🐟🦐 Next Generation of Aquaculture 🦐🐟
We are solving global sustainability problems at land-based fish and shrimp farming, with a new farming technology.


Farmed seafood is an alternative towards wild caught seafood, therefore lowering the demand of wild caught seafood helps the transition towards sustainable wild fishing methods. But today's farming of fish and shrimp has challenges in feed, health, eutrophication and water consumption.

Nära & Naturlig has developed a new farming technology and by mimicking nature's own way of cleaning water, the unsustainable challenges are solved and economical advantages are obtained.

In our technology the farming water is cleaned in a natural way by algae, bacteria and other small organisms called microbes, instead of today's technical cleaning filters which need to replace 1-10% of the total water volume each day. For us the residual products from the farm are cleaned by these microbes and the fish/shrimp in its turn will eat the microbes, creating a natural ecosystem inside the farm which enables 100% reuse of all water and residual products. Also, this microbial farm enables microbial metabolism of food by-products, the system indirectly produces high quality fish and shrimp from these food by-products. The natural microbes give a natural feed for the fish/shrimp and a superior health is observed. Also the natural feed of microbes gives the farmed fish/shrimp a superior taste. Specific Data on the technology: 30% higher feed conversion rate, enabling 100% replacement of marine protein towards plant based in the feed, lowering protein content of feed by 34% without affecting growth rate and health, (this plant- based feed with lower protein levels constitutes a feed with lower environmental impact). This new technology is published in the scientific journal Aquaculture.

🦐🐟We are focusing on following global sustainability goals 🐟🦐

Nr 14 Life below water.
We offer an alternative to wild caught seafood, which aids the establishment of sustainable fishing methods and enables recovery of the marine ecosystems
 
Nr 12 Responsible production and consumption.
We promote sustainable consumption and production through a circular water and nutrient system, that in the internal production is reusing all farming water and residual products. 

Nr 9 Sustainable industries and infrastructure. 
Industries become more sustainable through the reuse of their food by-products and waste heat. Serverhalls or industries with waste heat can be used to heat up the farm.

N 2 Zero hunger.
The final goal is to develop a sustainable fish/shrimp farming method in Sweden, which can be established internationally and above all help developing nations to get access towards safe and nutritious food produced in a sustainable way. 

The farming technology will be sold with a licence model towards self owned regional partners. Nära & Naturlig will sell farming unit-models that are easily scaled in numbers towards the requested farm size. Through a licence fee on the yearly turnover the partners get the knowledge transfer of how to create and maintain a safe and efficient farming system. The partner also needs consistent delivery of the secret recipe of premix material form Nära & Naturlig that sustains an efficient and safe system. Nära & Naturlig also constitute the whole-saler of the produced fish/shrimp from the partners and will sell through its high end brand of sustainable, natural, healthy and locally produced seafood. Sweden is seen as a good verification country and market, but as soon as possible the technology and fish/shrimp sales will be established internationally.

Pesitho is a Danish based enterprise, committed to providing affordable and clean energy solutions for cooking to marginalized and vulnerable people around the world. We have developed the ECOCA solar powered electric cook stove, to meet the daily cooking and energy needs to families living in off grid areas. Pesitho has established a locally run co-operative outside of the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda, from where stoves are assembled, distributed, and serviced by refugee residents and members of the host community. The company was founded in 2018 and has a combined experience of more than 30 years in the renewable energy industry.

The Problem we are solving
 Currently, 4 billion people around the world lack access to clean, efficient, and affordable access to energy for cooking. Polluting fuels and technologies for cooking have a detrimental impact of health, nutrition, gender, and the environment, hindering the process of a sustainable development, in many cases, in already fragile settings. The lack of progress in clean cooking, reportedly costs the world more than $2.4 trillion each year, driven by adverse impacts on health, climate, and gender equality. Left unaddressed, communities will continue face multiple adverse consequences, that are further amplified by poverty, climate change and future global pandemics.

To solve this problem
Providing access to an affordable and sustainable technology for cooking with the ECOCA solar powered electric cook seeks to address energy security not just for cooking but also to reduce environmental issues like deforestation, pollution, also gender inequality and poverty. Research and design for our stove was conducted with residents of the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement in Northern Uganda, where pilot testing permitted additional adjustments, allowing for a stove specifically designed to meet the cooking needs of vulnerable groups of people living in off grid areas. The ECOCA comes with a solar panel, insulated 6l cooking pot, 1 LED rechargeable household lamp, 1 LED rechargeable torch and USB ports for charging small items. Studies conducted with end users by organizations such as Caritas and World Food Program, have shown improvements to overall health and wellbeing, reducing exposure to harmful pollutants from smoke and usage of firewood, improvements in taste of food, income generation from USB port charging station and hours saved from collecting firewood being reinvested in education and skills training.

The Spark
Pesitho was founded on the belief that all should be able to have access to modern clean energy for cooking. Seeing a map over Africa showed that a large portion of the continent is without access to modern energy. This sparked a willingness to learn why. Understanding the why lead to the understanding of scale of lacking modern energy in that region of the world. While other continents where mowing a positive direction in relation to rural electrification sub Sarah Africa is still mowing in the wrong direction with the number of people living without access to electricity growing. This knowledge inspired the team to pursue the development of the ECOCA, off grid E-cooker

Intellimeal,Sweden,intellimeal.se,2020,1-10,"Education, Healthcare & Life Science, Food & Beverage",B2G,Pre-seed,"Swedish public meal services are regulated by law. We have identified a great conflict in combining a heavy compliance service with a great craftsmanship. The result is a situation where our children do not eat enough or not at all in school. This means an increased risk for long-term health and not the least concentration and energy throughout the day. School and canteen personnel struggle to live up to compliance in nutrition restrictions and other regulatory requirements. Climate KPI's such as food waste, budget constraints and at the same time ensuring that the children eat a nourishing and tasty meal is challenging and a balancing act which requires experience and tools with sophisticated data to support their work.

We have identified three major areas for improvement; 1) Lack of a structured recurring way of collecting feedback from the public meal guests (children, school personnel), 2)  There is only one player on the Swedish market offering an IT tool for planning and follow up the meal process. This is a monopoly situation and a huge risk of being irresponsible with tax money, not meeting the needs.  The existing tools offered have a high focus on compliance and reporting and less on the guests and the taste and positive experience the meal should give. 3) The increasing alarms of children not eating in school and not getting satiated due to not enough nourishing meals. This is both a risk for the health of next generation and an unfair situation where the children should be served an equal meal wherever you live.

We have several main target users. The main customer is the school management and the municipalities. As meal planning is a core process involving many stakeholders, all contributing to fundamental steps in the process, we also see important values to each of these user groups; dietitians, diet economists, meal planners, school chefs, teachers, students and caregivers.

All user groups have been involved in our analysis. The function that got the most attention was the feedback function involving the guests. That is unique and there is no such service available in existing tools. It is also requested as the schools need to comply with the authority requirements of collecting feedback throughout the year as part of their meal policy.
As we are planning to release our meal planning ecosystem over time, we have during the fall of 2021 carried out a proof of concept among 150 pupils and teachers focusing on one of the main problems - continuous feedback from guests - in a project called skollunch.se. The result proved our concept and the feedback of our test came out very positive from the target groups.

We want to offer an intelligent solution for meal planning that proactively suggests a tasty meal based on budget, sustainability, nutrition and rating. With artificial intelligence, business intelligence and interactive functionality, the users will be guided in the meal planning process with engaging and simple interfaces. The core of Intellimeal is situation-based recommendations heavily relying on data locally and globally creating automated meal planning whenever needed and requested.

Intellimeal contributes to reducing food waste and at the same time improving knowledge and understanding of sustainable patterns of consumption. We want to contribute to educating the next generation in nutritious food choices to prevent life-style related diseases.

We want to work proactively and support the school lunch system with automated and simplified meal planning that result in a more equal and fair meal experience nation-wide, regardless of what the municipalities spend in school lunch budgets and chef experience.

LifeBonder,Denmark,lifebonder.com,2021,1-10,"Media & Entertainment, IT & Software, SaaS",B2C,Bootstrapping,"In the last decade we have seen the consequences of a growing disconnect between social media and real life - and the subsequent declining mental health among young adults. And we spend a quarter of our lives in virtual social systems according to Center for Human Technology, a think tank in California.

Loneliness, social media addiction and the declining mental health in young adults, has formed the main focus for our team, to improve the quality of life for 18 – 40 years old young adults – especially 18 – 25-year-old adults.

Loneliness and mental health issues gives rise to healthcare costs - in Denmark alone, 20% of working age people suffer from mental illness resulting in 25% of all healthcare costs.

The business model of current social media growth engines is designed around consumerism and addiction as a profit-maximizing mechanism and is markedly anti-social and therefore due for a significant disruption - LifeBonder is that disruption. LifeBonder is putting the social into social media – or rather where it belongs, outside social media.

That so many young people report lacking close real-life friendships and feel lonely despite existing competitors, clearly demonstrates failure to meet the market despite existing “social” platforms. LifeBonder is therefore filling this growing need for real life experiences outside social media platforms - battling the negative impact of social media and thereby increasing the quality of life for young adults.

What differentiate us from other current social media platforms is our focus on supporting our users in their real life in the local area. We suggest shared interests, activities, locations and communities in the local area and motivate people to meet. LifeBonder:

•	supports people offline in the local area instead of keeping them online
•	have no additive elements – likes, followers, etc.
•	prevent social loneliness and isolation
•	is a safe space that allow the real “you” without need for pretending
•	has zero fake users accounts and zero fake news
•	protects users’ privacy - We do not sell user data nor track user behavior at all

Least but not last this product will provide a new innovative friendship platform, make a positive impact in society and of course be a profitable business case!

We thus have a strong focus on sound quality, rather than loudness, and we can reach the low price due to automated production in the worlds largest factory.

We started this because we needed it for ourselves and saw the need for others. We asked all the piano enthusiasts we could reach and get the interest in our product confirmed.

Problem: The cumbersome booking of the wrong psychologist 
In Denmark, mental disorders account for 25% of the disease burden and cost society 55 billion DKK annually with more than 2,000 people receiving therapy from a psychologist every day. Further, too many individuals do not receive timely help as they cannot cope with the draining 5-hour process it takes to find and book a psychologist. At the same time, U.S. experience shows that only 20-40% of people find a psychologist they trust and have 'chemistry' with. This is tragic, as just one bad experience can cause a client to completely drop out of or postpone his/her therapy. The ineffective booking process and the risk of a poor patient-therapist match mean that many people continue to struggle with mental illness who could otherwise be treated. This has major consequences for individuals whose mental illness markedly impairs their quality of life, but also largely affect their family and friends. Furthermore, this is a major problem for society, which is negatively impacted by lost labor and growth and must shoulder the high costs associated with mental illness.

Solution: A simple approach to booking the right psychologist 
Healper is a friendly guide and a booking platform that matches clients with psychologists. We have designed a comfortable, simple, and transparent user journey, that takes the client by the hand and helps him/her through therapy to mental health. Clients fill out a short questionnaire and are then matched with the best results from our database of more than 1,700 psychologists. Here, we find the psychologist who can statistically give the best treatment. Clients are presented with a prioritised list of three psychologists along with the reasons for the match. From this list, clients can choose which psychologist they like best, book a session, and pay. The platform continuously facilitates feedback from clients and their psychologists to improve the processing and precision of the matches.

We have developed an innovative technology that assists healthcare professionals with increasing their qualifications in analyzing and interpreting electrocardiograms (ECG) through 3D visualizations of the heart and data-driven artificial intelligence. 

According to WHO, heart diseases are the largest killer in the world. Heart diseases and conditions are located and diagnosed with the use of ECG. This heart examination is practiced by General Practitioners, EMTs / Paramedics, Nurses, Doctors, and Cardiologists. Misinterpretation of ECG analysis leads to misdiagnosis, which might lead to fatal consequences for patients and the social economy. A British study estimates that up to 68,5% are misdiagnosed with heart failure.

HATO's new digital solution analyzes heart diseases from ECGs using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The software solution increases the foundation of decisions of the healthcare professionals and combines 3D visualizations with our ML models for real-time animation of the patient's heart. All of this will assist healthcare professionals with localizing abnormalities and allow them to react faster at critical events. Innovative and easy. Long story short, the software platform will raise the bottom level of ECG interpretation and give all healthcare professionals a cardiologist by their hand.

Nutriverse,Denmark,nutriverse.dk,2021,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Kort beskrivelse
Vi hos Nutriverse arbejder for at udvikle en platform, som vil gøre det muligt for folk at leve et sundere, og derved bedre, liv.

Hvilket problematikker forsøger vi at løse? 
Vi lever længere og længere - men vi bliver ikke ligefrem sundere. Hvad er gevinsten ved at leve længere, hvis det blot er flere af de dårlige leveår vi får? Vi vil tilbyde folk i alle aldre lettilgængelig og forståelig information, til at få det bedste ud af den tid vi har. 

Fakta om danskernes sundhed fortæller lidt om hvor slemt det står til
51% af danskerne var overvægtige [1]
19% af danskerne er svært overvægtige [2]
58% af danskerne bevæger sig ikke nok [2]
Danskernes mentale sundhed er styrtdykket [2]
5% af danskerne har diabetes [3]
10% af danskerne tager kolesterolsænkende medicin [4]
Hver dansker spiser 6,6 kg slik om året [5]
Mht til overvægt så vurderer Kræftens Bekæmpelse at andelen af overvægtige danskere vil være 66% hvis udviklingen fortsætter og andelen af svært overvægtige vil være 29% i 2045 [6]

Hvordan kan vi løse problemet
Forebyggelse er et af de vigtigste værktøjer til at vi kan forblive sunde og raske. Mange mennesker er i bund og grund sundhedsbevidste, eller har en ambition om at være det, men har ikke tiden eller værktøjerne til at træffe de rigtige valg, når det kommer til deres sundhed. Internettet flyder over med forskellige sundheds-tips og råd, som kan være svære at navigere i, og hvad er egentlig sandt?
Nutriverse er et sundhedsunivers hvor folk kan få indsigt i deres egen sundhed, og få værktøjer til at optimere deres sundhed, gennem evidensbaseret information.

Hvorfor ønsker vi at løse dette problem
Ingen ønsker sig flere leveår hvis det betyder at man ikke har helbredet, energien eller fysikken til at leve livet. Vi har i Danmark ikke tradition for at tænke meget på forebyggelse, når vi taler om sundhed. Alt for ofte lægger fokusset på symptombehandling. Derfor vil vi gerne være med til at løfte opgaven, således at vi alle kan have helbredet med os - så længe som det er muligt.

ENGLISH VERSION

We, at Nutriverse, aim at developing a platform that'll provide the tools for people, to improve their own health - and thereby life. 

What problems are we trying to solve? 
We live longer and longer lives, but we aren’t exactly getting healthier. What's the point of living a longer life, if the years received are filled with hardship and disease? We want to offer people of all ages, understandable and accessible information, to get the best out of the time we are given. 

Prevention is one of the strongest tools we’ve got, in order to stay healthy as long as possible. Many people are essentially health conscious - or at least have an ambition to be - but don’t have the knowledge or time to make the right choices about their personal health.
The internet is flooded with different health advice, which can be hard to navigate through - and what is actually true?
Nutriverse is a health-universe that provides people with evidence-based information that can be used to optimize their own health.

Nobody wants more years added to their life, if you don’t have the energy, health or ability to live life. We aren’t too concerned with disease prevention in Denmark, way too often the focus is on symptomatic treatment. 
That’s what we want to change, so that everyone can get the chance to live a long and healthy life.  Location DenmarkWebsite nutriverse.dkFounded 2021Employees 1-10Industries Healthcare & Life ScienceBusiness model B2CFunding state Bootstrapping",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

100 million patients undergo an MRI-scan every year. But 1 in 5 patients have implants like stents, pacemakers or an artificial hip. Due to the strong magnetic field of an MRI machine, implants can get burning hot or even ripped out of the patients body. So the highly specialized health professionals waste large amounts of critical time to adjust the MRI-machine according to each specific implant. Every setting is a special setting for the specific implant and the right settings for each implant is found by Googling… this is both time consuming and dangerously uncertain for the patient.

That is why we developed an implant database that ultimately frees up 1000s of hours in a single hospital and gets rid of Google.

Since the beginning of the company, we’ve worked on spreading kendama on a global scale. The rise and growth of the kendama community has allowed KROM to spread, and the team to travel the entire world.

In 2010 KROM was founded by 2014 freestyle kendama world champion Thorkild May in hopes of igniting the kendama love wherever possible. Since then we’ve worked hard to develop the kendama culture worldwide from the KROM HQ & Shop in Copenhagen.

From the KROM Shop, we host a weekly kendama club and work to support similar initiatives like kendama clubs in Colorado and Latvia. We also sponsor a large number of events every year with prizes and pro players and host events ourselves, like the 2019 European Kendama Championships.

As kendama was developing across the world, KROM naturally grew with it and the ideas of creating our own kendamas and becoming more involved in the community couldn’t be kept down. In the latter half of 2012 KROM Kendama went from mainly being a crew of homies playing and distributing kendamas to starting the learning process of creating the best possible kendamas out there. Leading up DAMAFEST 2013, the North American kendama championships, KROM started to pick up steam with the recognition of the clean dama designs and crazy tricks. Thorkild May and teammate Mathias Rasmussen ended up winning the American Freestyle Championships, laying down what has become a staple of the KROM image: the signature Danish flow and the recognizably funky kendamas.

Since then KROM has developed and grown even further, we’re constantly striving to represent the kendama community in the best way possible, and of course to provide the best possible products to all the supporters in across the globe. With every new kendama, we’re determined to improve both the playability and the design. For these purposes and more, we’ve gathered the most winning team in the world, composed of internationally acclaimed players with several World and European championship titles, as well as a lot of homies to help us reach our goals.

We’re grateful to be able to take kendama to new heights through our work and we look forward to seeing where kendama takes us next. We’ll keep working to bring the joy of kendama to new people every single day. Kendama is unique in its ability to improve your cognitive functions and your hand-eye coordination while connecting people everywhere, even across language barriers, making us able to communicate all over the world. Kendama provides something real and tangible in a time where things are becoming more abstract than ever before.

We love the toy that lets us step away from an increasingly digital world, allowing us to refresh and reconnect with the people around us. We hope that you can feel our passion and affection through the products we create.

Linker ApS,Denmark,linker.team,2020,1-10,"Service, Marketplace & eCommerce, Sports",Marketplace,Seed,"Linker is a social app for trainers and fitness enthusiasts. The aim of the app is to create a robust community of both professionals and beginners to link people with similar interests and needs in sport. We strive to make the process of connecting health lovers simpler than ever. Linker was created with the intention of bringing people with similar interests together in a welcoming sports community.

Who are we?
Linker ApS is a sports tech start-up with the plan of creating a mobile application, where users can find a personal trainer, join group training sessions or find a fitness buddy.

Linker app provides an easy-to-use, centralized platform where users and customers can easily find, connect and communicate with each other.

Today, many people invest time and money into a healthy lifestyle. We realized they require more freedom and flexibility. Our aim is targeted at users, who do not want to be bound by a monthly subscription in a specific gym or specific type of sport. 

We want to connect users who are looking to try new sports, participate in different group sessions both out- and indoors, find training buddies to keep each other motivated, or purchase a personalized weight-loss program with a trainer. The possibilities are nearly endless. 

Linker wants to focus on trainers who want to provide their services, group sessions with few participants at a time, and/or individual training sessions. We leave the freedom of setting individual schedules and prices to our trainers.

The app aims to create a platform for those two diverse groups to interact and connect - easier than ever. 

Why join Linker? 
The Linker team was inspired to create this app after seeing how people in Denmark find fitness buddies, personal trainers, and other group training sessions. We have noticed many people still use social media groups to connect. However, there are many irritating and not user-friendly limitations that come with this method. 

Firstly, social media groups have no centralized search engine, where you can look for specific events or posts. This results in an overflow of posts like “who wants to go for a run?” or “please advise a good personal trainer in cycling”.  Another way is old-fashioned word-of-mouth. This way, you are only getting feedback from one person regarding the received services.

How does Linker work? 
Our Users (Linkers) will have free access to full app functionality, where they can search for personal trainers, group activities, and fitness buddies with filtering options by location, interests, type of sport, ratings, prices, and much more. They will also have the possibility to rate trainers for all users to see. 

Our Customers are personal trainers in Denmark. Trainers earn money by providing personal training, organizing group training sessions, and selling training packages to app users and the Linker App takes a fixed commission from each transaction. 

Linker app also has a built-in social media-like feed for sharing sport-related content, where Linkers and Trainers will have the ability to link with each other, send messages, as well as make and share posts.

Quickit,Denmark,quick-it.dk,2020,1-10,IT & Software,B2B,Bootstrapping,"YOU KNOW IT
Sitting at a Restaurant and trying to get in contact with a waiter to either order or pay the bill.
You can see that the staff is busy and not very easy to get eye contact with.  
In some cases it takes 10-15 minutes to either order or pay the bill.

THE SOLUTION IS
It’s a software developed to assist the staff while serving all the visiting guests by allowing the guests to order and pay through their own smartphones. 
This application minimizes waiting time and dispersion of bacteria, it eliminates queues and increases up sales. Despite all of that it’s also a direct marketing channel between restaurant and guest.

Vision: Quickit’s vision is to be the leading Scandinavian ordering and paying application when dining in. 

Mission: Quickit aims to streamline the service by assisting the waiters and become the quickest and easiest way to order and pay. 

Problems solved with Quickit
-	Minimizing waiting time 
-	Eliminating queues
-	Empty tables
-	Streamlining service
-	Up sale
-	Marketing directly to the guests

We were a bunch of girls who enjoyed meeting up at cafés to chat about all and nothing for hours, as a break from our exams and boyfriends.
We would buy a café latte and then one more and sometimes we would have wine instead. 
The only problem we met again and again, were the time we had to wait for the waiter in between our orders and mainly when we wanted to pay the bill and leave. 
Often the result were that we wouldn’t order the extra café latte or glass of wine, because it simply took to long time.
The subject of our conversation then changed into how we could solve this problem and optimize our visits and so the concept began to take shape. 
Not only would the concept solve the problem that gave us the idea, but it’s beneficial for so many other reasons. Like during Covid where we need to social distance and the restaurants gets a direct marketing channel to their guests to promote themselves and set up nice deals to fill their tables. 

With my (Anne Sofie, Founder) 7 year industry knowledge from being a waiter and manager alongside with my studies, I could then put together the two needs from respectively a business and an user and create a beneficial concept that would make the restaurant experience even better!

Wayer,Denmark,wayer.io,2022,1-10,SaaS,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Mental health app for the younger generations, helping them deal with stress and anxiety. Through writing sessions, users work with their past, present, and future version of themselves. 

By writing about their past, users get a better understanding of the experiences that have formed them and how they can accept and learn from them. Traumas, conflicts, and bad experiences are like kitchen dishes - they will keep growing in size as long as you ignore them. By mapping their life into chapters, users are helped to realize which situations they are still bothered by and how they can reach a state of closure.

This leads to a better foundation for how they can learn to appreciate and praise the good things they're currently doing in their lives - mental skills that are hard when you only compare yourself to the best versions of other people you see on social media. The younger generation is heavingly hit by a feeling of not being good enough which takes a massive toll on their mental health. This can be counteracted if they continuously train themselves to be grateful for the good things that they have achieved. 

Nietzsche once said that to live is to suffer; to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. It's therefore extremely important that the younger generations are helped to define what they find meaningful in their lives. But how do you do that? Meaning is strongly connected to the responsibility we take on our shoulders and by helping users define what their ideal future looks like, we help and motivate them to live a more meaningful life.

Paper Cutter Games,Denmark,papercuttergames.com,2020,1-10,Gaming,B2C,Pre-seed,"WHO ARE WE?
As a studio that embraces diversity, Paper Cutter Games is dedicated to giving voice to people and issues that have historically been crushed or swept under the rug.

We believe that our players deserve to feel seen. And this begins with opening doors that help us better understand our peers. One of our primary goals as a studio is to challenge stereotypes and the simplifications saturating the video game market. Our “international and diverse team” is a power-up we’re proud to keep equipped. 

WHAT ARE WE DOING, YOU ASK?
Paper Cutter Games is an indie game development studio dedicated to achieving mass-market appeal through constructing compelling narratives supported by its game mechanics, UX/UI best practices, level design, and art. We thoughtfully and accurately explore complex themes through intensive and continued collaboration with subject matter professionals, and continue the conversation beyond the game by providing interested players with resources to learn more about the subject matter or get involved in related community projects.

WHY ARE WE HERE?
We solve 2 major problems facing the present video game industry:
1. Gameplay lacks cohesion with the narrative, breaking immersion, creating frustrating experiences, and leading to churn.
2. Complex themes (like mental health) are rarely tackled in an engaging and accurate way; when they are, the conversation ends when the credits roll.

We also harness the 3 key factors to growth/success in the games industry (according to the International Game Developers Association):
1. Diversity in game content
2. Advanced game design
3. Innovative storytelling

HOW ARE WE TACKLING THIS?
Our first game is Project Filter (working title), and centers on the themes of mental health and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD), perception, and healing from trauma. Since our main method for exploring this theme is using game mechanics rooted in metacognition, i.e., awareness and understanding of one’s own thought processes, Project Filter is being developed in collaboration with the Danish psychologist house Cektos Center for Metacognitive Therapy. This combination of themes and their in-depth exploration with licensed psychologists has never been done before.

Our competition ignores this new and uncharted niche of providing narrative-informed gameplay with deep exploration of any mental health issue. The overarching goal of our startup is to become the proprietary eponym of this niche.

Project Filter is the first of a franchise that will speak to our studio’s ethos and throw open the industry’s doors to diverse content and major advancements in narrative game design.

Currently, our team is focused on developing our demo and securing additional investments.

WHY ARE WE TAKING THIS RISK?
Game development is a risky venture, but our team is passionate about art, video games, and pushing the envelope. We imagine a future where the game dev industry doesn't just welcome diversity and the exploration of complex (and sometimes uncomfortable) subject matter, but embraces them. This ideal, and our personal connections to the themes encompassed in Project Filter, drive us to see our studio succeed and become a top studio in Europe.

Besides fossil fuels, the production of concrete is the worst emitter of CO2 in the world. However it is the most used material within the construction sector. But not for long: climate legislation is about to make concrete a whole lot more expensive, by introducing a CO2 TAX. This leaves the construction companies with a problem as there is no valid sustainable alternative they can use. 
HEMBOO offers an easy solution: prefabricated walls for new construction made of hemp and bamboo with a reduction of 80% CO2 emitted compared to the traditionally used concrete walls.

BUT the construction industry is very conservative and risk-averse. Therefore getting to market is a long journey. We built our first prototype are now preparing for the second one and are gathering data on the needs of our customers. Our aim is to provide a solution similar enough in prefabrication and installation methods, to make the transition from concrete fast and easy. Our element is designed for large scaled production so that we can have the largest impact. 

Recently we have received a total of 520.000 dkk in soft funding for product development and are participating in multiple startup support programs so it is full speed ahead!

We are a diverse team of three, Elsa Maria Iuliano, Helena Brandt Rejndrup and Michael Hallam.

●	Fuelsave, a German CleanTech company reducing emissions of the world’s largest combustion engines.
●	Hiber, an open metaverse platform enabling anyone to create virtual worlds in apps and web browsers.

The founders of Dreamcraft are also the founders as well still the dreamer (CEO) and crafter (COO) of what is now a +1bn USD global and listed company. Inspired by their journey, mission and DNA, we are hands-on venture engineers supporting similar teams through engagements that go deeper than just advice, guided by our core values:
•	Progressive e.g. in the way we build companies.
•	Proper e.g. in the way we make investment decisions.
•	Down to earth e.g. in the way we engage founders and others stakeholders.

Wavers by SundhedsDanmark IVS,Denmark,wavers.io,2018,1-10,"Healthcare & Life Science, IT & Software, SaaS",B2B,Bootstrapping,"Wavers is developed as a result of the challenges with mental health that workplaces are faced with today. Mental illness is increasingly prevalent, and The National Research Center for the Working Environment (NFA) estimates that the direct and indirect societal costs of mental problems are 55 billion Danish kroner (approx. 8 billion USD). Sadly, the corona crisis has certainly not contributed positively to this trend. The crisis generates huge insecurity for companies and their employees and can potentially trigger mental problems such as anxiety, stress and depression.

We have just released our app “Wavers” which is supported by the union “the Velliv Association.” Wavers is a dynamic health platform that detects and prevents problems and challenges at workplaces before it turns into serious problems.

Read more about Wavers and watch a short video that explains the app here: https://wavers.io/

The unique about Wavers is that it starts with the employees. Through our app, employees are urged and motivated to take responsibility for their own and their colleagues’ wellbeing by answering questions (that can be asked by everyone), while maintaining their anonymity, until the unique reach out-feature is used which gives the unsatisfied person the opportunity to accept a helping hand from another colleague. Therefore, the workplace’ mental health becomes a shared project and responsibility for all employees. As a result of this, we hope that Wavers can help create a culture based on constant care and support at workplaces around the World, starting in Denmark.

Relocare Taxation International ApS,Denmark,socialsecurityapp.eu,2016,11-50,"IT & Software, Legal",B2B,Bootstrapping,"Relocare has developed Social Security App which helps companies and employees to be safe and compliant at work in EU.
Social Security App is a digital tool for social security and application for A1 certificates for business travelers, and for handling of compliance and applications under Posted Workers Directive.
Both EU directives causes a lot of problems for companies that work cross borders, and we at Relocare have the solution.

Social Security App, handles all data management for EU and EEA countries for A1 applications. We provide HR with a full overview in the Dashboard for A1 applications and compliance for all EU and EEA countries. In addition, we have automatic application for A1 to the authorities in Denmark and Sweden and thereby save between 30 to 60 minutes per application.

Business travelers traveling without an A1 risk fines of € 5,000 as well as claims for social security payments in the country they visit for work purposes. It has been a legal requirement for years, but the new thing is that the countries have established a common communication system which makes it much easier to control the A1 applications and employees. Legal registration requirements are required even for a business travel of just a few hours duration, so it is quite serious and demands a lot for the companies. 

HR and admin can create reports in the Social Security App from a Dashboard where they can see the estimated travel activity from each country 12 months ahead, the individual employee's travel activity and the total travel activity when the employees have confirmed that they are traveling for the company.

Social Security App also comes with a warning if an employee travel into a country where they do not have social secuirty, and HR can always get an overview of the countries the employees have applied for A1 for via the App.

There is no doubt that we see significantly increased control and employees after / during Corona are significantly more aware of whether the company takes care of them. Social Security App secure the employees on the business trip and ensure that they do not lose their social security rights.

Today most prosthetic sockets are handcrafted based on experience and trail-and-error, which is very costly. We have developed a new digital prosthetic design engine called Snapform SimFit that can calculate the optimal shape of a prosthetic socket using a patient-specific simulation. The ability to digitally design sockets enables cost-effective industrial processes such as 3D print, making high-quality prosthetics accessible to everybody. 

The first patients are already successfully using our sockets and we are now looking to commercialise the technology further.

AsoY,Denmark,artspeaksofyou.com,2017,1-10,"Healthcare & Life Science, IT & Software","B2C, B2B, B2G",Bootstrapping,"AsoY is an impact-driven Health-Tech StartUp.

Our product is a neuro-intelligent app that builds and strengthens mental health and personal leadership. 

We challenge a large-scale problem, which is stress that costs somewhere between 10-20 billion kr a year in Denmark alone – not to mention the severe personal costs.  

When it comes to stress, A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS that it doesn’t follow reason. 

You cannot rationally decide to get rid of stress, because it messes with your brain by blocking important cognitive functions. 

SO: to BREAK OUT of stress, you need to BREAK THROUGH these cognitive barriers.

AsoY does that with a radically different solution that literally “BLOWS THE MIND”, as it automatically breaks through cognitive barriers. 

It does that by using an unusually effective and effectful element, which is visual art that  operates on the stress’ terms: behind the cognitive system. 

You don’t have to know ANYTHING about art to feel the effect, because when you look at works of art YOU LIKE, cutting-edge research shows that it immediately lowers cortisol and inflammation levels in your blood, while serotonin and oxytocin boost your energy and calm down your nervous system.

Moreover, AsoY is based on founder’s 10 years experience practising as a professional coach & stress coach and her ph.d. on how art automatically affects the brain (from mirror neurons, the limbic system, memory, concentration and focus to the nervous and hormonal system). 

That combination of theory and practise forms the basis of the app’s 5 simple steps that guide the user with clear instructions and questions to an ultra-personal experience leading to insights which encourage action towards beneficial change, immediate effect and long-term impact. 

SO, WHEN IT COMES TO BREAKING THE CODE TO MENTAL HEALTH, there is rational evidence for strategically using an irrational element, which most people would consider works of art to be. 

AsoY invites it’s users to choose a work of art that speaks to them and guides them through a step-by-step process in which they realise that it also speaks about them. They discover that the piece they have chosen mirrors important sides of themselves. 

The process facilitates direct access to the CORE of the users' personal resources, which they can use in their current situation to address the challenges they face here and now. 

AsoY EMPOWERS USERS with a daily tool to build long-term personal leadership, reduce stress naturally, break out of it automatically and avoid falling into relapse.  

We’ve tested the method with a. 1000 people and 90% say that it changes their mental state from unease and overwhelm to peace of mind, mental clarity and the energy to help them focus, prioritise and make decisions about what’s best for them, what makes sense and what makes a noticeable difference in their lives.

We are close to our users and witness how they interact with the app, because we use it as tool in workshops and 1:1 coaching sessions. 

We know it works. Now it’s time to scale it up and let app stand alone.

BUT, in order to sell it B2C in its own right and to the B2B clients we already have as well as to the B2G clients, we have in the pipeline, we need to upgrade the simple but fully functional MVP to a full-blown commercial product.

THAT' WHY WE ARE LOOKING FOR INVESTORS AND 1-2 TECH CO-FOUNDERS in UX and code, who are:
-	passionate about the fast-growing market for health tech, digital health, mental health and arts & health, which Google has just launched a large platform to support
-	attracted to the idea of getting ownership in an impact-driven health tech startup and lifting a proof-of-concept MVP to a commercial product that can reduce stress naturally and automatically and build and track mental health over time. Anonymously, of course.

Every month up to 1,000,000 paint buckets are thrown out in Denmark. NONE are recycled. Due to an updated EU legislation, paint-suppliers will be economically responsible for the disposal of their packaging in 2025. We have discovered multiple pains in the current outdated design. These include; hard to sort, dispose and recycle, heavy lifting in awkward positions, sharp handles, prone to spillage in cars and while pouring, strenuous to open, not air-tight due to dried paint and many biocides needed to keep the paint fresh. 

We switch the main material from plastic til reusable cardboard, coming up with a completely new design. A product with better handles, easier to open, faster to set up. It is designed with the professional painter in mind, eliminating the need to pour paint and designed to fit into the use of existing roller buckets. A special opening has been developed with the potential for a patent application. 

With a large network in the painting industry, we - 6 Process & Innovation students at DTU - set out to place the industry on the path to sustainability. We, however, believe that a product needs to be more than just sustainable to gain real traction in the industry. We strive to solve some of the many problems we have met, lowering numbers of back injuries and being more sustainable, with a great product. We are so close to a final win-win-win product, being cheaper for the manufactures, more sustainable, as well as faster and safer to use for the painters.

Boardmemore,Denmark,boardmemore.com,2020,1-10,"Marketplace & eCommerce, Travel & Tourism",Marketplace,Bootstrapping,"Boardmemore is developing a marketplace for sports equipment rental where people can rent equipment from each other.

There are far too many unused things in our wardrobes, cellars, and garages. According to Greenpeace statistics, we buy an average of 60 items of clothing a year, 40 to 80 percent of which gather unused dust in the wardrobe. In addition, there is all the sports equipment that is only in use a few days a year. From skis, to water sports equipment, to tents and folding boats. If you were to rent these products instead of buying them, it would be cheaper for the consumer and more sustainable for the environment. And if you rent from your peers, it's even easier and more accessible!

What sparked the idea? 

On a sunny day in Copenhagen we wanted to take a paddle board and have a tour in canals that slightly remind Venice. As we already had one board, we were missing another but we couldn't find where to rent it. And then our idea was born. We asked ourselves how might we create P2P marketplace for sports equipment rental and how to make different sports activities more accessible to everyone?

We are all subject to far too much sensory input, hectic schedules and increasingly stressful lives. The result is that most people have a dysregulated nervous system, and this takes a toll on physical and mental health. 

Everyone can benefit from floating, and we have a wide range of guests! People use it for muscle restitution, to alleviate symptoms of stress and anxiety, for pain management, PTSD, arthritis, sleeping disorders, skin conditions, brain fog/mental decluttering and as a powerful tool in meditation, visualization and problem-solving. Massage is a very complementary treatment, and our therapists can do wonders when working on a body that has already had 1 hour of pure blissful relaxation in the float tank. 

We have a focus on the customer experience, ensuring that each guest is guided through their floating experience from start to finish, and has the time and space to ""land"" again after their session. Our space and our service allows people to enter a new state of mind, let go of their day, and return to their body, emotions, naturally-relaxed state of being. 

We believe that floating has enormous potential in today's society. Our founder Shelley started to float 8 years ago in other countries and it helped her to recover from a very stressful period of her life. She was driven to open Denmark's first float space in 2019 together with experienced massage therapist Boo Hilmer.

Mendonca Biomed,Denmark,mendoncamedicalbiotech.com,2020,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,B2B,Bootstrapping,"Mendonca Biomed is an early stage life science startup with the aim to develop and validate novel biomarker for the early detection of viral infections in blood with a simple and affordable detection method that can be universally applied. 
The company was originally founded by myself Kevin Mendonca in India based on his 15 years of accumulative research knowledge.
         Around the world, more than 92 million blood donations are collected every year. Screening of donated blood and derived products, for HIV, HBV and HCV is mandatory worldwide.  Screening is a key safety measure in protecting recipients from transfusion transmitted infections, especially in developing nations in Africa and Asia, where the donated blood is not processed because of high costs and lack of infrastructure. Moreover, in emergency situation like natural calamities, disasters and sudden outbreaks, the currently available methods are inadequate for on-site screening.
Serological testing (antigen and antibody detection assays) have historically been the foundation of blood screening but with huge drawbacks of long window periods. Newer strategies like the PCR based amplification viral genomic DNA/RNA in blood have helped shorten the window period but have not eliminated it. PCR assays have also been known to fail in low viremia and/or suboptimal amplification efficiency. They are far more expensive than the serological assay, requires expertise, specialized equipment and a molecular biology setup, which is not available in the resource poor settings of the developing countries.
Our solution is to develop and validate novel viral miRNA biomarkers that have the potential to further reduce the window period and use the unique characteristics of these biomarkers to develop a simple, multiplex (3 in 1), inexpensive probe hybridization assay that can be universally utilized in all settings and conditions. Viral miRNA molecules are easy to validate as biomarkers since the presence of vmiRNA’s is a definite indicator of infected cells. 
Benefit:
Multiplex 3 in 1 test.
Method as simple to perform as the serological assay with the benefits of a molecular assay.
Can be adapted in any setting, even in the field and low resource conditions in developing nations.
Potentially, lower window period of detection compared to any biomarkers that are available in the market currently.
Value:
High throughput, lower turnover time with lower chances of human error.
Advantages of a molecular assay with the simplicity and affordability of a serological assay.
Does not require specialized setup, infrastructure and highly trained technicians.
Potentially, could detect the infections faster than any other tests in the market, lowering the risk of transfusion transmission.
Once this platform has been validated, the product line can be expanded to cover all commercially viable viral infections. A HPV assay based on this platform, for example, could be a potential replacement for the invasive PAP test, and can be performed during a routine blood test. The platform can be further adapted to screen for novel viral infections like SARS, MERS, ZIKA etc.  It can be also be developed to screen and control other sporadic outbreaks the like Dengue, Chikungunya etc.

Maka,Denmark,makadesign.com,2020,1-10,Fashion & Living,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Maka is a designer of premium quality bags, clothing, boards, and apparel for skaters currently launching worldwide with our first two products; water-resistant skateboard bags in two unique designs that make transporting your board 100x easier.

Who is behind Maka?
Maka is driven by a dedicated team in Medellín, Colombia. Maka is the brainchild of two skaters; Diego Pineda (CEO) and Jorge Calle (Lead Designer).

Diego was born in Colombia but fled to Arizona, USA, with his family in 1999 due to violence. He picked up skating immediately and would go on to work for skate shops and tour the country with a team. He returned in 2008 to study International Business, although he never put down his board, certain that he would find a way to make a living out of skating.

Jorge was born in raised in a small ghetto in Medellín, Colombia. While many of his friends found their way into drugs and violence, Jorge found his way forward in life either on top of a skateboard or behind a sewing machine. His true passion is to create without limits, to try, to fail, and to try again until he’s created the best there possibly could be.

So Diego, why did you start Maka?
I live a pretty simple life philosophy; I do what I enjoy doing.

However, like everyone (especially skaters), it can be hard to do what you really enjoy and pay the bills.

I’ve always looked up to the skate culture for inspiration ever since I started to understand it – the style, the clothes, the street, the attitude to be against the norm of society… It’s a close-knit community, although it’s an individual activity. You don’t need a team to be able to skate. It’s a way of self-expression, and that, for me, is the starting point of it all.

What is the ambition of Maka?
There are not many cultures that truly accept everyone. Skateboarding does.

White, black, green, yellow, purple, tall, short, weird, funny, cool – everyone is accepted because it’s about your individuality.

For the majority of my life, most of the people I’ve met come from skateboarding. It all comes down to having fun. Learning, falling, and getting back up.

So, why does all of this relate to ambition?

Because, while we’re taking the brand worldwide, we also want to seize the opportunity to support more kids with what skating has given us; a way to express ourselves, a sense of purpose, and life-long friends.

Skating made our lives what they are, and now it’s time to give back.

10% of all profits go towards supporting social causes here in the city of Medellín. To follow us on our mission, we invite you to follow our social media to help more children find paths away from the drugs and violence that are still present in this city.

Guiding you through your first thoughts of getting a pet, to providing you the best overview of your obligations and opportunities as an experienced pet owner.

Pet owners get a lot of information from veterinarian professionals. The official documentation today is paper documents, handwritten notes and stickers. Many pet owners therefore find it difficult to understand whether they are complying with their obligations.
﻿Also, these documents are required when at training, pet-sitters, vet visits etc. and are often forgotten or misplaced due to their physical form.

Successteam,Denmark,successteam.com,2019,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS",B2B,Series A,"People first. It's good business. 

There are countless obstacles in any leadership situation when driving a happy, motivated team that also has to perform their best not to mention to improve every day. Many leaders today got their role through seniority because they worked their way up, which is excellent. Still, great leadership skills don't appear with many years of experience in a certain position. Leadership skills have to be learned and always developed, as a leader has the most significant responsibility of all, the people. That is not an easy task and as organizations develop into more remote work and diverse teams the challenge has never been bigger.

We have commissioned each other to settle for mediocre leadership because leaders are too busy with other assignments than checking in on the people. But this needs to change, and all change is difficult. Changing leaders' mindset to put people first, will create happier team members who are less likely to quit, which will leave everyone more motivated to do their tasks. Motivated team members deliver better results, and that is good business. It's not a cliche it's a fact.

We have built an easy-to-use tool that supports leaders in creating and upholding a feedback culture, where leaders improve and develop through honest feedback from their team members. We help leaders identify and take action on team challenges ensuring happy and motivated teams with the best conditions to perform.

The products (formulas) that are currently available on the European market consists of highly processed ingredients such as maltodextrin, protein powder and vitamin and mineral powder. It is not unusual that patients using formulas suffers from multiple symptoms. The two most common are diarrhea and vomiting. Recent clinical studies show that blenderized food leads to significantly less incidents of diarrhea and vomiting and most important of all, a better quality of life.

In Bellyfood we developed a series of real food meals for tube fed people. Our meals are nutritionally complete, gives sensory impressions and are similar to the meals that people would eat with their mouth. Bellyfood are for people from the age of 3-elderly. The product is categorized as Food for Special Medical Purposes. We offer vegan meals and meals made with primarily local ingredients.

Our competitors lack agility, willingness to innovate and most of all, competition. A recognised market study shows that 40% of tube fed people in Scandinavia are seeking a real food product. Bellyfood is currently the only company in Europe offering series of tube-feeding-products with 100% real food.

The founder of Bellyfood, Line, started Bellyfood when her son, Otto, did not thrive getting conventional tube feeding formulas. Until Line started introducing real food blends, Otto vomited several times a day. Line holds a background in civil engineering and has strong skills within analytics and numbers in general.

Pia, the co-founder is a clinical dietitian with more than 10+ years experience within the field of tube feeding. Pia has seen how big an impact food can have on a patients ability to thrive and lot at least on life quality in general and thinks that every tube fed person should have the possibility to choose real food as well as commercial formulas.

Today, dialogue in the caregiving sector is inefficient and insufficient. 
Time is spent on coordination, not care. Dialogue is on practicalities, not personalities.

By 2050, 17% of the global population will be 65+. In Denmark 65+ year olds will increase by more than 40%. Many of them in need of care. Global shortages in the caregiving sector leaves relatives to be the backbone of caregiving. Relatives who are juggling caring for elderly family members with holding down full-time jobs.

Kintella offers multiple services through one user-friendly platform. We digitize and automate the coordination of calendars and tasks. We structure and target the communication. At the same time, we integrate with health care systems. 

Kintella started out of a personal experience of the founders. At the same time as a family member moved into a care home in Denmark, other family members moved into care homes other places in Europe. The family wanted to be able to stay close and follow the citizens in their everyday life as it was difficult to visit - especially during Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe. 
We were faced with having to coordinate a lot of tasks and calendar-topics - both with the staff and within our group of relatives. Moreover, communication from the care homes was poor in some areas which affected the quality of the dialogue with the family members and staff badly. 
We dream of the day when staff or a relative of a citizen in a care home comes up to us and says that Kintella has supported them in providing a better value of life for the person they’re taking care of.

CBD is a key ingredient of the cannabis plant, specifically coming from a type of plant called hemp and hold no psychoactive content. It is therefore regulated differently than psychoactive cannabis. The market opportunity is large. CBD makes up for almost 75% of the total European cannabis market and the market is growing rapidly.  
    
Reliable studies show that:
-	Many CBD products marketed contain only 28-55% of the declared CBD content
-	Many CBD products marketed contain the much weaker/cheaper synthetic CBD isolate instead of being based on broad or full spectrum CBD
-	Up to 38% of CBD products marketed contains THC above the legal limit (0.2% in Europe and 0.3% in the States)
 
In addition, hemp is one of the fastest growing plants in the world and therefore easily absorbs pollution from the dirt and environment. 
 
This means that many CBD customers today are either purchasing:
-	a weaker CBD content than expected
-	may be purchasing an illegal product above the legal limit for THC and/or 
-	may receive and be using a polluted CBD product.
  
The Green Heart of Copenhagen GmbH solution to the above is based on:   
#1 Thorough due diligence of CBD suppliers globally
#2 Tightly controlled supply chain  
#3 Extra layer of reliable third-party testing of all individual product batches before any products are offered for sale.

Vi er et team af specialister med dyb teknisk forståelse, og ideen til unikk.me opstod, da vi koblede vores viden om teknologi med ønsket om at gøre en forskel for den enkelte bruger. Mængden af data er stigende, og brugere, organisationer og leverandører indsamler løbende data, men al den indsigt og viden skaber først værdi, når det omsættes til initiativer, der gør en konkret forskel for brugeren. 

Vi vil gerne bruge digitalisering til at skabe en integreret og unik brugeroplevelse. Tænk hvis optikeren, udover at sælge kontaktlinser og briller, kunne anvende de halvårlige synstests aktivt ved at lade data følge brugeren. Derved kan brugeren nemt stille alle sine synsdata til rådighed for eksempelvis et forskningsprojekt, der forsker i lige præcis den øjenlidelse, som brugeren er arveligt disponeret for. Det vil forbedre behandlingen for brugeren, gavne forskningsprojektet og bevirke, at brugeren får en præference for lige præcis den optiker, der lader data følge brugeren. Konkurrence fordele handler om lige præcis det; evnen til at give brugeren nogle fordele, der er unikke. 

Indsamling af data åbner også op for helt nye muligheder for at udvikle nye løsninger og produkter, der kan være med til at gøre en forskel for den enkelte. Dermed vil kundeservice få en helt ny betydning og have en direkte effekt på livskvalitet og personlig sundhed. 

Vi vil gøre data til den nye grønne bundlinje ved at gøre det muligt at koble personlige data fra brugeren, med data indsamlet via en leverandør og offentligt tilgængelige sundhedsdata. Det vil gøre brugeren til en aktiv sundhedsbruger, der får fuld valuta for sine data, og det gør organisationen i stand til at skabe bedre rammer for øget trivsel.

unikk.me er designet til en digital hverdag, hvor der er taget hånd om data. Det er fundamentet for vores teknologi. Vi tilbyder indhold til meningsfulde sundhedsydelser, der gør en forskel. Så vi sammen kan skabe øget livskvalitet for brugerne. Hver dag. Hele livet.

Airplant increases the effect of nature's ability to purify and humidify air by combining plants and technology.

20-40 % of office workers experience dry indoor air. The feeling is triggered by dry air or chemicals  which cause general discomfort. As you may know, plants reduce chemicals and humidify air. The Airplant system boosts the plant's natural way of working, and an airflow expands the treated area so that one single plant has the effect of 10 plants, corresponding to or better than comparable machines. Ventilation systems switch indoor air with fresh air. But fresh outdoor air is dry during the entire flu season so the Airplant system will humidify the fresh air and also reduce the amount of harmful chemicals.

Sustainability is at the heart of our product, our production and everything we do in our company, guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We strive to make the world a better place to live: Airplant's mission is to support health at the office.  

We love to work with ideas that solve important problems and to bring the products to life, to do product development, prototyping and the initial low volume production. We do our own research and development - standing on the shoulders of NASA, among others.

The problem & the idea
Data may be the driver for change, improvement and understanding, in many sectors, amongst these also healthcare. Patient data is an important creator of knowledge both on an individual level but also on a group, regional or country level. On an individual level, patient data may support and build the clinical decisions, it may provide more efficient treatment, both in regard to time and economy and secure that knowledge about the individual is transferred fast and unbiased to the healthcare staff. For the patient, sharing of his/her data will secure a better understanding of the needs and support better diagnosis and treatment. 
Patient data are collected and noticed in some form in most countries, either on paper or electronically. Many countries have some sort of an electronic patient journal, either on a country level, regionally or locally. However, many countries also still use pen & paper. This challenges the storage and continuity of data collection and transfer. Patient data records in electronic form reduces the risk of losing valuable data but also allows the data to be shared if needed.
The acknowledgement of the importance on several levels of having patient data and the absence of a central, regional or local electronic patient data recording system in Sub-saharan African countries (the target region) initiated the idea of looking at how it would be possible to collect and make patient data readily available for treatment, benefitting both patient and caregiver, and in a bigger perspective, for research and strategic healthcare initiative planning.
During small initial market and possibility investigations the idea of creating a patient owned electronic healthdata journal app arose. Mobiletechnology is both greatly advantaged and outspread in the target region and the number of mobile consumers are increasing every year.
It was and is anticipated, that the possibility of having a central system is, due to structural and financial reasons, not a possibility but to empower the patient with the ownership of own data through an app seemed a possibility. It is important to underline that data must be generated from the healthcare provider and then fed into the patientjournal at the site of the consultation.
The idea is to have the most relevant data collected and stored in the app, ie. medication, allergies, blood type, diagnosis and immunizations. The data that will go into the app is transferred from a healthcare provider at the site of the healthcare visit, eg a clinique, hospital, other. That means that the healthcare provider must have access to a tablet or smartphone containing the healthcare provider app which connects to the patients healthcare data app at the visit. Also any healthcare provider with the app will followingly get access to the data from the patient by connecting (and by being given access by the patient) to get patients healthdata app.
So, in summary the basic idea is to provide all citizens with a tool that will help them keep track of their most important healthcare related data including completed and planned treatments, diagnosis, tests, allergies etc.
The idea is further that the data is owned by the citizens/patients, and not by the non-existing national or any hospital specific system.
Upon each contact with the healthcare personnel the patient's information is updated by the healthcare personnel (e.g. symptoms, diagnosis, tests, treatment, next visit etc.)
The basic idea/assumption is that no national healthcare system will be developed in near or short-term future, and that a personally owned ""electronic patient journal"" can have a significant positive impact on the quality of treatments because of a more complete picture of the patient is available at the time, when a diagnosis and treatment is to be decided.

An estimated 10% of all women, i.e. more than 300,000 women in Denmark, suffer from UI. The condition is still widely considered a taboo and has no effective treatment today. 

Sundhedsstyrelsen recommends the following treatments by order of effectiveness: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT); pharmacological therapy; and surgery. Surgery, used as a last resort solution, is expensive and has poor response rates. Pharmacological therapy has shown slightly better response rates but is accompanied by non-negligible side-effects. PFMT is a highly individual and specialized procedure. Done correctly it is a cheap, non-invasive procedure void of side-effects. There is a proven need for a tool to allow healthcare practitioners (HCPs) to standardize treatment, teach correct exercises, and collect data accurately. Our device is a non-invasive vaginal probe, offering users a new, data-driven best practice of supervised PFMT, AI nudging to improve adherence and patient education.

The fully automated method optimizes existing treatment methods and improves HCP’s in their workflow. Our device can directly decrease existing UI related health economic costs by mitigating expenses from diapers and surgery-related expenses.

MuskeBear,Denmark,muskebear.dk,2021,1-10,Consumer Goods,B2C,Pre-seed,"Hi! We are MuskeBear - and we are developing the next big thing for families with babies all around the world.  

Short about us: 
The team behind MuskeBear consist of Tobias Seegert (CEO) and Freya Herluf (CMO). We are two young students from Denmark that are working as machines on our incredible business idea.

We are developing a personalized Heartbeat TeddyBear! MuskeBear is a new concept that is going to revolutionize the traditional Teddybear by incorporating smart technology. More specifically our product is a combination of two things. A sweet and soft teddybear and a technological device that can record heartbeat soundtracks in a high quality and play it back too. 

Our product is developed based on a strong psychological foundation. Several studies have shown that babies have a special need for attachment with what we define as ""caregivers"". Caregivers are specific persons that a baby has a special relationship with. That would primarily be the baby's mother and father. If this need is satisfied, then the baby will be more curious, socially stable and in general better equipped for growing to be a socially well functioning human being. But! If this need on the other hand is not met, then the opposite scenario can be a possible outcome. 

Therefore it is safe to say that sustained positive attachment and security is a necessity for a new born child. Our product offers exactly this attachment, because it can be ASSIST whenever the parents are not able to be with their baby. That could be when the baby has to sleep, is getting babysitted, is in nursery and in many other situations.  

Go-to-market strategy and target group:
We operate on a B2C market. We are going to sell our product through our own channel, which is our webshop. Our primary target group IS parents with children AT the age of 0-2 years. This target group is also reflected in our marketing focus and strategy. However, our product is also suited for children that are a bit older.  

The thing that makes our product stand out in the crowd is our technology based solution. Our innovative solution enables mothers and fathers to record their own heartbeat rhythm- and sound in high quality and incorporate these audios into the teddybear. The fact that we enable families to make personal heartbeat recordings in their own home (Instead of requiring a scanning-process at a hospital or otherwise facilitated by the midwife) is revolutionary. We make the product accessible for everybody, and with our solution you can have your child's first teddybear become a family project. 

Why are we spending days and nights to create this product? 

Think about IT. We have conceived an idea that has the possibility to assist hundreds of thousands of families in establishing strong and caring bonds that will last for a whole lifetime. All due to the personal care and attachment that our product brings to the baby and the family. 

With other words we can make a living while making families happy all over the world.   Location DenmarkWebsite muskebear.dkFounded 2021Employees 1-10Industries Consumer GoodsBusiness model B2CFunding state Pre-seed",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vores team er ungt og frisk, så hverdagen er præget af høj energi, godt humør og mange sociale stunder, mens vi målrettet og ambitiøst arbejder hårdt for at forbedre livet for pårørende. 

Hvorfor pårørende? 

Pårørende er en kendt, og dokumenteret højrisikogruppe, der udgør 38% af den danske befolkning. Hver fjerde bliver selv syg som direkte konsekvens.

Langt de fleste pårørende er hårdt pressede, og mange har hverken tid eller mulighed for at møde fysisk op, eller at modtage behandling indenfor de normale arbejdstider. I stedet søger de hjælp på nettet, som er det eneste tilgængelige på de skæve tidspunkter– og her møder de korte generiske skriv om, at de skal passe på sig selv. Tilbage står den pårørende, magtesløs med spørgsmålet ”Hvordan!?”.


Med vores App kan den pårørende få faglig relevant hjælp og støtte på alle tider af døgnet uden ventetid – med handlingsorienterede løsninger og værktøjer, der guider dem til hvordan de håndtere den givne situation. De er uafhængige af deres fysiske placering, og oplever
at få den hjælp de har brug for, når de har brug den.

Vi har brugt flere år på at analysere og kortlægge, hvad pårørende mangler for at undgå sygemeldinger og tidlig afgang fra arbejdsmarkedet. Hver fjerde pårørende bliver selv syg med stress eller depression som direkte konsekvens af deres rolle som pårørende.

Pårørende har brug for psykologisk førstehjælp med høj kvalitet og tilgængelighed - tidligt! Det handler i høj grad om, at vi griber individerne med den rigtige hjælp inden det bliver kritisk.

Derfor har vi skabt ét samlet univers, hvor pårørende får al den hjælp de har brug.   Location DenmarkWebsite htpaa.dkFounded 2018Employees 1-10Industries Education, Healthcare & Life ScienceBusiness model B2C, B2BFunding state Seed",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Vi er specialiseret inden for familie- og arveret og har flere års erfaring med rådgivning og udarbejdelse af korrekte testamenter, ægtepagter og lignende produkter indenfor familieretten. Vi er uddannet på Københavns Universitet og Copenhagen Business School og har opbygget erhvervserfaring fra ansættelser ved advokatkontorer og juridiske virksomheder.

Vidste du at Dine Arvinger har hjulpet mere end 60.000 private og erhvervsdrivende med at udarbejde familieretligt dokumenter.

https://dinearvinger.dk/testamente/

HVAD ER ET TESTAMENTE?
Et testamente er et juridisk dokument, som giver dig mulighed for at tage stilling til hvordan arven efter dig skal administreres og fordeles. Derved sikrer du, at din formue fordeles præcis som du ønsker og ikke bliver fordelt efter reglerne i arveloven.

HVORFOR SKAL MAN OPRETTE ET TESTAMENTE?

Du skal oprette et testamente, hvis du vil bestemme hvad der skal ske med den formue, som du har optjent. Ligeledes skal du lave et testamente hvis du har særlige ønsker til, hvem du vil begunstige. På den måde kan du selv tage hensyn til dine familierelationer, f.eks. papirløst ægteskab og sammenbragte børn. Hvis du ikke opretter et testamente, fordeles arven efter arvelovens paragraffer, og du risikerer at arven falder i de forkerte hænder. Der er en række andre forhold du kan administrere med et testamente.

Det er i virkeligheden de færreste, som ikke har nogen grund til at oprette testamente.

https://dinearvinger.dk/testamente/

HVEM BEHØVER EN ÆGTEPAGT?
Hvis du og din nuværende eller kommende ægtefælle hverken har en positiv eller negativ formue, I sparer nogenlunde lige meget op til pension, og ingen af jer regner med nogensinde at komme til at arve noget af betydning, kan I normalt roligt holde jer til formuefællesskabet.
Hvis du har en vis formue – stor eller lille – mens din nuværende eller kommende ægtefælle ikke ejer ret meget andet end sit gode humør, sit tøj, og en stor studiegæld, er det ret så naturligt, at du ikke er særligt begejstret ved tanken om, at din formue vil blive halveret, hvis I skulle høre til de over 40 % af alle ægtefæller, som på et eller andet tidspunkt bliver skilt.
Du bør derfor tage dig mod til at og spørge din nuværende eller kommende ægtefælle, om han eller hun gifter sig med dig for pengenes skyld. Det ku’ være man blev klogere på sin ægtefælle.
Er svaret nej bør det ikke være super svært at komme til enighed omkring en ægtepagt, så du kan blive sikret mod skilsmisse og en deling af din formue.

HVAD ER EN SAMEJEOVERENSKOMST?
En samejeoverenskomst er en skriftlig aftale mellem to eller flere parter om, at de sammen ejer eksempelvis fast ejendom. Samejeoverenskomsten sikrer samtykke og klare rammer for, hvad der skal gælde i forhold til den fælles ejendom, og hvordan eventuelle udfordringer og konflikter skal håndteres.

HVAD INDEHOLDER EN SAMEJEOVERENSKOMST?

I en samejeoverenskomst kan man beslutte hvilke vilkår der skal være gældende for parterne under samejet, i forbindelse med samejets ophør og efter samejets ophør. Man kan blandt andet beslutte vilkårene for finansiering af købet, fordeling af overskud ved salg, fordeling af driftsudgifter, bestemmelse om salg og pantsætning, beslutninger vedrørende ejendommen, opsigelse, køberet, salg til tredjemand og hvad der skal ske ved dødsfald. Parterne kan i en samejeoverenskomst selv vælge hvilke vilkår der skal indføres, og er derfor ikke begrænset af ovenstående.

Dr. Stevens Pillow,Denmark,drstevenspillow.dk,2020,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,B2C,Bootstrapping,"My name is Steven John Widecrantz.
I am a Urologist at Sealand University Hospital in Roskilde Denmark.
For 16 years I have been treating Kidney Cancer Patients, but in recent years I have also been in charge of postoperative complications  and seriously ill patients in my department and lately also in the treatment of Corona-patients.
In this capacity, I have encountered patients so weakened by months of inactivity in bed, that former healthy patients couldn’t stand on their own feet or even sit up by means of their own.
They had an immense loss of muscle-mass and the malnutrition even affected their brain function.
Training and mobilizing these patients is difficult and time consuming.

To overcome some of these obstacles I invented the “Dr. Stevens Pillow”-system.
It is made up of a system of pillows with different resistance, carefully selected in collaboration with experienced physiotherapists to meet the requirements at the different stages of the patients recovery.
The pillow is placed in the foot end of the patients bed and the patient, the staff and the patients family are instructed in different exercises by the physiotherapist. The pillow can then be placed in the bed by the patient, the staff or by the family whenever the patient feels like training or when encouraged to do so, supplementing the daily training by the physiotherapist.

The pillows will, with the right instruction, strengthen the patients foot-, calf- and thigh-muscles, and it will strengthen the buttocks, the stomach-muscles and the back-muscles.

Secondary to strengthening the muscles, the training improves blood circulation thereby improving muscle-nutrition, wound-healing and the heart. Training also aids in prevention of blood-clots.
Lung function is improved, lung problems prevented, and more oxygen provided to the bloodstream.
Bedsores will also be prevented or healing improved.

The patients appetite is improved providing building materials for muscles and healing, and nausea is prevented.

Psychologically the patient is strengthened by being activated opposed to lying inactive in bed all day. The possibility to influence their own recovery will motivate the patients to train more.
When the patient is exhausted, the pillow is just removed, and the patient can rest.

The pillows are made of durable materials that can withstand daily use, and the fabric is hospital standard and easy to wash and disinfect for use for the next patient. No handles are added to ensure easy and safe cleaning.
The weight makes them easy to transport.

The pillows come in four different colors:
Green for the weakest patients.
Blue for patients that can sit, but not stand.
Red for patients that can stand with the help of a roller.
Black for patients that are able to walk a few steps, but still need to build strength.

The Black pillow can even be used at home, where it can also be used as a step-machine, a training bench and much more.
The size make it easy to store in a wardrobe.

The “Dr. Stevens Pillow”-system is so simple to use, inexpensive and versatile, that it can be used in almost any setting: Hospitals around the world, Refugee-camps, Retirement-homes, Hospices etc.  Location DenmarkWebsite drstevenspillow.dkFounded 2020Employees 1-10Industries Healthcare & Life ScienceBusiness model B2CFunding state Bootstrapping",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Droppe – One-stop shop for all your wholesale,Finland,droppe.com,2020,11-50,"IT & Software, Marketplace & eCommerce, Sales & Marketing",Marketplace,Seed,"Connecting local businesses to Europe's top equipment manufacturers via an online wholesale marketplace. 

———

Founded in 2020 in Finland, Droppe is building an online marketplace that brings European industrial equipment manufacturers and industrial buyers together. Currently, the top concern for industrial buyers is finding and stocking operating supplies that are painless to buy in bulk, low in cost and responsibly sourced. 

Industrial buyers can now bulk order products for food manufacturing and industrial manufacturing ranging from hairnets to aprons and protective gloves through Droppe’s online platform.  

Ultimately Droppe makes the European wholesale industry more connected by creating shorter and more responsible supply chains, as companies can look for local wholesale marketplaces from Europe instead of other continents. The company's easy-to-use online marketplace is already used by some of the biggest industrial key players and publicly listed companies in Europe. 

“As industrial wholesale moves online, more and more industrial buyers will be looking for new ways to bulk order products via the internet. Droppe is the first in the market to build a European industrial wholesale marketplace, a mission that we are excited to continue building and expanding with new resources,” Johannes Salmisaari, the CEO and Co-founder of Droppe, explains. “Our vision is to create a trustworthy community of European buyers and manufacturers and through that, build a stronger European wholesale market.”

In just under two years, Droppe has reached a GMV of over €4M and over 500 customers from SMEs to publicly listed companies, bootstrapped. In early 2022, Droppe raised a venture round backed by Lifeline Ventures, Ilkka Paananen (CEO & Co-founder of Supercell) and Miki Kuusi (CEO & Co-founder of Wolt).

“Droppe’s online marketplace streamlines the buying process and makes it easier for industrial buyers.

Freyja XO Oy,Finland,freyja-xo.com,2021,1-10,Media & Entertainment,Marketplace,Seed,"Freyja is initiating a new era for social media platforms, moderation practices, and user protection. Its sophisticated moderation and safety system is ground-breaking and allows it to offer a voice to a marginalized group of creators.


Educators, charities, and brands, who offer important sex-education and awareness, don’t have a platform to promote their cause. Mainstream social media censors any mention of sensitive topics, such as sex, and ban creators without warning. As a result, the human right of sexual education is being denied, which is particularly problematic when women’s sexual rights are being stripped away repeatedly.

Charities that focus on reducing revenge porn and image based sexual abuse find themselves censored, or banned for talking about their work. 
Companies focused on sexual health testing, period products, sex therapy and contraception also find themselves banned or censored 
Educators try to improve education and find themselves censored for naming a body part. 
Sex workers face the worst discrimination as they are instantly deleted, even when they haven’t posted anything more explict than a bikini photos, whereas a celebrity might post something actually pornographic or link directly to an adult site and not face the same censorship or bans. 

Freyja acknowledges this overlap of education and adult entertainment and addresses this by offering a safe environment, where people can find what they are looking for: education or entertainment. Freyja is a social media platform, which does not censor or discriminate. It’s a platform, where individuals, charities, and brands can post about sex-education, their products, and their charity work. Creators can monetize their content with a range of payment options or post content for free, like on any other social media platform.

We respond to a fragmented maternity market by creating a modern healthcare solution that supports mothers from start to finish through smart products, 24/7 access to expert advice, education, and technology.

At Lola&Lykke, our goal is to educate, connect, and prepare women for the physical and emotional rollercoaster that often accompanies the journey of becoming a mum, so that all women feel supported during this major life change. At Lola&Lykke, we believe in MAMA FIRST, and the best choice any parent makes will undoubtedly be an informed one. Our goal is to empower parents with the information and support they need to be the happy and healthy parents their children need.

In the middle of our busy family lives, taking care of ourselves often takes a backseat. Still, we are acutely aware that a mother is only able to thrive when she is looked after too. If we can encourage mums to look after themselves more and make them feel less alone with the changes in their life and body, then we’ve done what we set out to do.

Mum-founded and mum-run, we know the ups and downs of motherhood. If there’s one thing motherhood has taught us, it’s that you can’t do it alone. Our collaborative team of experienced midwives, physiotherapists and other experts work together to navigate, educate, and help mums make the choices that are best for them. Together we can ensure that each woman gets her voice heard, gets the support she needs, and is able to thrive throughout the entire journey of becoming a mum.
 
We are two Finnish mothers driven by sky-high standards and the belief that maternal care should be safe and accessible for everyone. We are dedicated to making that a reality by setting a new standard for maternal health by using clinical research, healthcare expertise, and digital technologies to create an experience that is unified, evidence-based, and personalized. From our collaborative healthcare expert team, motherhood community, and digital support platform, we are there to support you each step of the way.

To support our mission towards equality, We Encourage builds a conversational Artificial Intelligence tool AINO for providing psycho-social support and guidance to women victims of intimate partner violence, gender-based violence, and promoting sexual and reproductive health.

Violence against women – particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence – is a major public health problem and a violation of women’s human rights. Global estimates published by WHO indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

The AI tool is expected to act as a reliable source of information for women on their rights and where to seek different levels of support. The tool will be providing step by step recommendations to victims and act as a helping friend. This intervention is expected to address a chronic development issue and to have a cross-cutting impact on SDG 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and SDG 5 ( Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls). Furthermore, the AI tool could also help in building a network for anonymous peer to peer support networks among users who are experiencing similar incidents.

The tool is build in collaboration with violence survivors, professionals, and collaborating NGOs.

LS CancerDiag,Finland,lscancerdiag.com,2013,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,"B2B, B2G",Series A,"LS CancerDiag has developed DiagMMR®, a unique predictive diagnostic test to detect Lynch syndrome. We provide easily interpretable and highly accurate results even before cancers develop, enabling preventive and personalized care.
Unlike current methods requiring tumour tissue, DiagMMR® only needs a very small skin biopsy of healthy tissue to detect LS in patients and in healthy individuals alike. This allows for an early diagnosis, enabling cancer prediction and preventive treatment, while unaffected family members can be relieved from regular follow-up. This gives clinicians a reliable tool to choose the right treatment for their patients, but also to screen healthy relatives even before tumours develop and provide true personalized care for patients and their families.
The company was founded as a spin-off from the University of Helsinki in 2013. The validation of DiagMMR® has shown exceptional accuracy for the industry, with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 89%. LS CancerDiag has patents in 29 countries across the world, including Europe, the US and China. DiagMMR® is CE-marked as in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD MD) and the company is currently working on obtaining ISO 13485 certification, which will be followed by the application for FDA approval.
Commercialization has started in Finland and the company laboratory serves the home market through two distribution partners. The focus is currently on the European expansion followed by the US market entry. LS CancerDiag is looking for partners to achieve its ambitious goal for DiagMMR® to become the Gold Standard for Lynch syndrome detection at a global level.

6D Tape,Finland,6dtape.com,2016,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,"B2C, B2B",Seed,"6D Tape is unique, patented and active therapeutical tape which works in six directions. It features handles and is skin-friendly, making it well suited for lymphatic therapy, physical therapy, scar treatment and active self-care.

The unique 6D handles allow manipulation that stimulates lymph flow, blood circulation, fasciae, scar tissue, muscles and joints. Treatment with 6D Tape will improve recovery from injury, ease joint and muscle pain, reduce nerve compression and swelling, and help with constricting scar tissue.

6D Tape has many therapeutic uses. 6D Tape is effective for treating back, neck and muscle pain, as well as swelling and joints. Manipulating the tape with the handles alleviates pain and reduces swelling by activating the body’s internal cleanup and healing mechanisms. The tape is also suited for treating surgical and traumatic scar tissue and swelling. For example, the tape is excellent at treating repetitive strain injuries, including golfer’s, mouse and tennis elbow, and constricting connective tissue (fascia).

6D Tape works well with  patients having Lymphedema, which is a painful chronic condition that causes swelling of limbs and disabilities affecting more than 250 million people worldwide. It has considerable public health significance, characterized by a continuous need for medical treatment, many comorbidities and detrimental effect on patients’ social life and career. It is particularly common among breast cancer survivors with a prevalence of about 40%. The number of lymphedema cases is rising as the number of cancer survivors increases with more effective treatments. The life quality of these people keeps declining dramatically as there are no solutions to manage this condition effectively and live a normal life at the same time.

6D Tape Oy is developing an automated therapy tape system 6D Tape Pro designed for efficient self-care to alleviate lymphedema, as well as pain, scars, and swelling after surgeries and injuries. The tape can be conveniently worn under clothes without interrupting any daily activities. The automated pulsation provides a gentle pressure treatment in planned and natural lymph flow-mimicking intervals. This enables lymphedema patient’s body to function and drain lymph similar to normal body preventing edema. The solution will reduce overall treatment costs and burden on health care systems.

Our patent-pending solutions are huge steps forward from any other treatment option available, enabling a lucrative positioning in a €7 billion market. The funding we are seeking is instrumental to take on the high-impact project closing the gap from technology prototype to a clinically validated product suited for mass market. Moreover, the new equity enables to secure enough operational capacity for a successful market launch.

Today, district hospitals can only analyze simple blood tests themself. The rest have to be transported to test centers, often located at the larger hospitals. Current ground-based transportation logistics between hospitals is unorganized, inefficient, and costly. This new way of transportation will increase the frequency and flexibility of test delivery, as drones can be deployed on an as-needed basis, which will drastically improve the diagnosis process in districts. An analysis posten IEEE showed how drone transportation of biological samples could save the Danish authorities 300 MNOK/year. 

This commercial potential has been confirmed by our contact with health regions. We currently have three paying contracts: one with St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim and two in Sweden.

Eyecheck System,Norway,eyecheck-system.com,2016,1-10,"Healthcare & Life Science, IT & Software, SaaS",B2B,Seed,"The Product
Eyecheck System is a modular SaaS platform that effectively enables sharing of clinical imaging, referrals, and other clinical correspondence instantly and securely between healthcare professionals, such as optometrists, eye doctors, and hospitals. 
By digitizing the patient journey we enable quicker treatments and fewer patient queues as we can process more patients with uncomplicated diagnoses more effectively. 


The Problem
The prevalence of the most common retinal diseases, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), is rising in industrialized countries. In addition to demographic changes, this trend is also partly driven by growing numbers of patients with diabetes. This is increasing the workload in hospital ophthalmic units, and public ophthalmologists leading to waiting times of up to 12 months in Norway. This in turn increases the risk for serious eye damage in the general population at risk.

The Solution
Eyecheck System is a modular SaaS platform that shares clinical imaging, referrals, and other clinical correspondence securely and instantly between healthcare professionals. 
This in turn enables decentralized controls and diagnosis of patients even in rural areas with sub-optimal eye specialist coverage. 
Decentralized controls and screenings are made possible due to the vast amount of geographically spread retina imaging devices in over 600 optometrist locations throughout Norway alone. 
In addition to that, there is a wide-ranging discrepancy of competence levels across the profession of optometrists, where such a service would benefit both the patients and the optometrists. 

The reason why
We are passionate about Eyecare and want to avoid blindness and other serious eye complications in Europe by digitizing the patient journey and creating a modern, more sustainable way to help patients get better. 
Our founder is an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) in Akershus and embarked on this journey due to his own experience when meeting patients that waited unnecessarily long on their appointment and ultimately an uncomplicated diagnosis.

Customers are challenged with finding rated services, getting fast access to treatment and managing their treatment each day from prehab to rehab. Injuries that are not treated quickly lead to chronic disabilities, exercise programs not followed lead to reinjury 

Meditt*  is a marketplace for healthcare services and a toolkit for customers and clinicians to help them with the day-to-day financial management of their treatment and services from prehab to rehab. Meditt* offers fast access and incentives for customers to complete treatment, whilst offering up-to-date solutions for clinicians to manage patient administration.

The current value chain leaves little room for the squeezed margins of small clinics. Technology stacks are old and software expensive. Customers want to support and incentives to manage their treatment and increasingly demand digital-first solutions however, the race for data and reporting has also made customers wary of sharing data with private companies. 

Meditt* aims to solve this by developing an end-to-end solution for customers and for clinicians, which not only reduces the risk of reinjury but allows for a telerehabilitation first approach to treatment. Drastically reducing risk and costs for Insurers and offering flexible cost-effective solutions for customers and clinicians.

 In order to address data privacy concerns, Meditt* will exploit technology developed by internet pioneer Tim Berners Lee which exceeds current privacy and compliance regulations. This creates unprecedented privacy control for customers. Whilst still offering the automation and data insight and access that healthcare providers and insurers need to efficiently report and treat patients. 

Meditt* started as a side project and research project whilst working at Tryg Forsikring as a result of a chronic back injury and desire to improve the whole end-to-end treatment process. The project so far has been developed by internationally market-leading researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs and has so far demonstrated significant results.

There are few new business concepts that aim to do something really fundamental and create a shift in the way a whole area of service design and treatment is approached. 
Technology is a powerful enabler, we are living through a great period of transformation we have the possibility to create meaningful impact and create a better future for everyone.

SignLab,Norway,signlab.co,2017,1-10,Education,B2B,Seed,"The Pitch
SignLab helps families that need to learn sign language or sign-assisted communication to communicate

The What
Parents to children who are severely hard of hearing or deaf need to learn sign language to communicate. Today, only 1 in 4 parents to deaf children in high-income countries manage to learn sign language. In low-income countries, it is believed to be less than 1 in 10.  

Families with individuals that benefit from sign-assisted communication face the same challenge. These include the parents to children with Down Syndrome, severe autism or Cerebral palsy.

The How
An international learning platform for sign languages and sign-assisted communication.

The SignLab learning platform is fully digital and can incorporate new languages within weeks. The user only needs access to a smartphone or a computer. 

The platform makes it fun and easy to learn through gamification and timed encouragement. To ensure that the user gets the most out of every learning session, our review functionality incorporates an AI that knows what signs you are about to forget. The AI then designs a learning session that is tailored to the individual user’s need. 

Our curriculum is designed in cooperation with sign language teachers in each language. 

The platform launched in open beta in Norway November 2018. Feedback from parents and sign language teachers gave it a NPS of +64. The platform saw exponential growth with an average growth rate of 276% each month for the first three months (Nov-Feb). This growth all came from word of mouth, $0 spent on marketing. 


The Why
Today less than 10% of the 64 million parents to deaf and hard of hearing children know sign language due to the low availability of education centers.  

Exclusion from communication have a significant impact on everyday life, causing feelings of loneliness, isolation, and frustration. The inability to properly communicate have a significantly adverse effect on the academic performance of children.

SignLab works towards a society where all families have access to teaching themself, their children and their community signs and sign language so that everyone can feel included.

carryon.bike is developing an AI based online platform to bring the cycling community under one roof.  
I found that there is no platform where the cycle community can find varied information that is relevant and uptodate and exactly as per their needs and behaviour. At the same time the patience level to comb through websites for relevant information is decreasing. 
The objective of carryon.bike is to provide and suggest information that is helpful to anyone from the cycling community. There will be many who have started considering cycle for commuting, exercising , or weekend gateways. Even tourists would prefer bike tours. So a global platform to cater to needs of all and encourage more and more adoption of cycling to adhere to the new norms post COVID outbreak and at the same time contribute to a greener planet 
Example, if a visitor to the portal is looking for renting bikes for touring a city during the weekend and wishes to rent an e-bike for few hours, showing the person a shop that rents mountain bikes and Race Bikes ONLY, would irritate the person.
This also gives more exposure to the shops and brands.
Another example to explain how we wish to solve problems:  When casual office commuters wish to buy a bike, they would feel comfortable getting advise from an expert. Carryon.bike becomes the platform where domain experts would answer to practical questions and guide them to make the right choice in current scenario based on the person’s age or city or road conditions etc.
This idea sparked during the corona times when I found friends and family and even celebrities getting anxious to go out of their houses for exercising, sightseeing and some fresh air. The regular office goers who were dependent upon public transport were thinking of walking down to office but felt it was time consuming. 
The young adventurous population like the high school students or university students wanted to take up cycling tours during weekends and felt they could not find enough bike routes.
It was evident that there will be even more needs for cycling and with demands will be a need to get more and more info, or consult people for unexplored or unknown topics.
So why not build carryon.bike -  the Craigslist of cycling industry.

In the most devastating cases of healthcare planning, faulty planning has led to deathly outcomes. Planning what, when and where to allocate resources are challenging in both private and public healthcare organizations. Lack of statistics and quality evaluation in order to prevent further inaccurate planning leads to a negative spiral. Current systems on the market are not sophisticated enough to solve these problems due to generic designs and manual planning functions. 

Our solution is Lingon. A smart planning tool for home care organizations.

Meela is a platform with over 250 licensed psychologists and psychotherapists, and over 170 individuals in therapy through us. One of our most important KPIs for us is therapy drop-out, because today 50% of people starting therapy drop out before session 3, mainly because of a poor therapist-patient match. Meela's drop-out rate, thanks to our matching technique, is today as low as 2.2%. Meaning, people not only start therapy but the finish is also. Meaning, they get help for their mental illnesses.

Meela is a consumer-facing product, and we want to get away from the feeling of ""sickness"" of therapy. Therapy is not about being sick, it's a tool for personal development: both for healing and thriving.

Meela is a female-founded company, co-founded by the British Tiffany Boswell and the Swedish-Greek-Finnish Natali Suo. Meela is an intersection between tech, psychology and business.

Perfekt i en hektisk vardag "" On the Go' "".  Vi arbetar också med vår GRL PWR community där vi inspirerar, stärker och motiverar. By Women for Women.

Problem & Why:  
Intresset för en aktiv livsstil och hälsa har aldrig varit större samtidigt som vi trilskas med livspusslet i en hektisk vardag. Det är svårt att ständigt ha många bollar i luften och samtidigt få i sig någonting bra som kroppen vill och behöver. 
Träningsprodukter känns ofta väldigt hårda och maskulina. Nu är det dags för ett koncept som är helt anpassat efter kvinnokroppen och dess unika behov. Varje produkt innehåller en ”Add On” av vitaminer, mineraler och superfoods utöver produktens primära funktionalltiet.  Perfekt på språng när du inte hinner med lunchen eller när middagen blev alldeles för sen, eller före eller efter träning. Funkar också bra när du vill byta ut ett eller två mål för att sträva efter en stabil viktnedgång. 

En vacker & stilren design: 
Designen är feminin och förpackningen är vacker, sofistikerad och stilren, den förgyller ditt hem som en vacker accessoar.  

Produkt:
Tillsammans med erkända näringsfysiologer tar vi fram och utvecklar produkter av hög kvalitét. Hållbarhet, Innehåll & smak är det allra viktigaste för oss, varje produkt har ett välplanerat och genomtänkt innehåll.  Smaken är så god att du tar en shaker när sötsuget kommer istället för att tjuva från godisskåpet. 

Community:
Vi brinner för vår GRL PWR community där vi arrangerar såväl fysiska som digitala träffar där vi tar upp relevanta topics som förändrar, inspirerar och motiverar. Vi använder oss även av VoiceHer som är världens första röstbaserade community för kvinnor där vi diskuterar relavanta ämnen med inbjudna talare.

Det är varken miljövänligt eller hudsmart. Företaget HUDs hållbara flerlagersdiskhandske både skyddar och har en lång livslängd tack vare innovativ produktutveckling. HUD är ett nytt svenskt varumärke med fokus på hälsa. I samarbete med Sveriges främsta universitet har vi tagit fram en rengöringshandske som skyddar huden. 

För sex år sedan stod jag (Wilhelm Bäckström) och handdiskade när jag insåg att vanliga diskhandskar inte skyddar huden utan förvärrar hudens tillstånd. Det beror främst på materialet de är tillverkade av (latex, gummi, nitril etc.), samt att den handsvett som uppstår inuti handsken orsakar irritation på händerna.

Till skillnad mot de vanligaste diskhandskarna som finns idag har företaget HUD, tillsammans med bland annat Sveriges främsta universitet, tagit fram en handske i flera lager som absorberar fukt från ett inre lager i handsken ut till ett annat absorberande lager, vilket eliminerar kontakten mellan huden och den handsvett som uppkommer inuti handsken. 

Det inre lagret är också tvättbart vilket både är fräscht och hållbart, samt förlänger handskens livslängd avsevärt jämfört med vanliga.

Every fifth person suffers from respiratory diseases like Asthma or COPD. Patients use an inhaler, but 90% make mistakes during the inhalation, leading to complications and breathless attacks. This represents a large market opportunity with millions of patients that we - a team of a medical doctor, a product designer and a business developer want to target.

What we have accomplished

1 - We have a prototype - a fully functional add-on device that can be attached to the inhaler. It is ready to be tested in larger patient studies.
2 - We have tested and verified our solutions with 20 patients and 40 naïve users.
3 -   We have spent 2 months of daily observing nurses, doctors and patients in the primary care centers.
4 -   We secured 1 MSEK funding from Vinnova, Solna Stad, EIT Health and KTH and we are set to accelerate with larger investment and EU funding.
5 -   We have developed the product and business in the KTH Innovation pre-incubator program.

The journey ahead

Our next step is developing the final prototype to be tested in a pilot patient study and prepare for manufacturing. We now accelerate our efforts towards finalizing the size, shape and usability as well as collecting measurements and handling data using our software. With the finalized product we will run clinical investigations to obtain a CE-mark. We plan to launch the product on the market in 2023.

About us

Andning Med was formed based on a clear need observed during clinical immersion. During the Clinical Innovation Fellowship program supported by KTH, KI, RISE and EIT Health the team got an unprecedented insight into healthcare challenges connected with COPD and respiratory diseases. Here the idea for a smart inhalation device was born. Our product is an add-on hardware device that measures the inhalation technique, giving live visual feedback every time. Our software collects data and enables tracking over time to motivate patients, involve family and inform doctors.

Andning Med is currently supported by KTH Innovation and is exiting a batch in the KTH Innovation Pre-incubator program. The KTH Innovation pre-incubator program is a 12 month program to accelerate the development of promising startup projects from KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Startup projects receive extensive support from inhouse Business Development Coaches as well as additional support such as office space, community activities, access to industry, mentor and investor networks.

VivoLogica is Europe’s top 3 MedTech startups on a journey to digitalize the workflow within the medical research industry. We have developed a system that helps medical researchers to save time - time that instead can be used to save lives.  

Why & How?
VivoLogica was founded in Stockholm in 2019 by the cancer researcher Sara Mangsbo. She realised that she and her colleagues spend up to half of their working time on manual and recurring tasks. Together with the innovation initiative Hidden Dreams, the entrepreneur and investor Saeid Esmaeilzadeh and our Advisory Board, VivoLogica has now developed a digital and user-friendly system supporting medical researchers with data compilation, reporting to authorities and to be compliance with regulations in accordance with current legislation.

By automating all manual and time-consuming tasks VivoLogica reduces administration overhead time by 75% - time that now can be spent on value-creating research that moves medical development forward and saves lives.

Punch Factory pays a amount to the facility and PT signs a membership with Punch Factory completely without extra fees or percentages.

Now a Personal trainer has a completely different opportunity to be able to make a living as a Personal trainer.  Where the majority of the fee goes to the PT himself and not to the facility.

The advantage is also that the facility does not need to have a lot of employed PTs and that the clients have several facilities to train with their PT.

I started developing the idea a little more than 2 years ago, the biggest reason is that I have always heard the problems that a Personal Trainer encounters when you do not have a job at a large gym chain. A personal trainer needs a gym to do his job, you can solve it in different ways, you get employed at a gym and then you usually get a small amount per time you hold a training session. Other alternatives are that you rent in a gym where you have to pay a certain percentage at the time as rental cost or a fixed monthly rent which is usually very high.

I know many who quit the profession because it is really difficult to get around as a personal trainer, high rents, poor working conditions, inconvenient working hours when, despite the rent, you have to adapt to the gym's own activities (group classes among other things)

That's why I developed Punch Factory AB, we make it easier to be a personal trainer, with just one membership you get access to different gyms to train your clients at no extra cost.

Our vision is to build the largest mobile parent network - first in the Nordics and subsequently in many other major European markets. 

We started out with the idea to help parents find others in similar stages of their parenthood in their neighbourhood, based on the search criteria that they want (e.g. age and gender of parent/age of the child). Our initial research showed, that especially first-time parents often lack friends that are in the same situation as them, so we wanted to give them a tool to change that. After 3 months of development, we launched our MVP of Bej in July 2020, in which parents could swipe through profiles of other local parents. Within 2 months, we have now acquired over 5000 users to our platform, with an average CPI of 10 SEK, average time spent in the app of 17 minutes per user and more than 50k messages sent between users.

Right now, we are working on new features, namely a mobile forum for parents in order to build up a knowledge base and a local pinboard, on which parents can post and see posts with child/parent-related things happening in their neighbourhood (events, sell&buy, etc.). Our research has shown that parents never seem to have enough information about what to do with their children in their local area and that they also like to buy used goods for children locally.

Important to mention is that we plan to always just provide the infrastructure for the users and never create any content (which is done by the users). Thus, we will be able to scale our app to other markets quickly, once the concept has been established in Sweden.

Aside from Sweden, we are looking to scale to the other Nordic markets Denmark, Norway and Finland, before launching the app in larger European markets like Germany and potentially Russia and France. 

Our current founding team - including a seasoned entrepreneur, two developers and one graphic designer/marketer -  has all the skills necessary to build and scale this app even further. On top of that our team is complemented by a representative from our early investor LU Holding from Lund, Sweden and from Jonny Rosengren, founder and owner of many successful parenting websites in Sweden and in the industry for 15 years.

Symptoms allows patients to chart all of their symptoms, functions and quality of life using scientifically validated health questionnaires, as well as charting of symptoms using a three-dimensional manikin. Symptoms presents the patient’s data to healthcare professionals in a way that improves understanding of the patient’s health priorities, thereby facilitating patient-centred care and shared decision-making. 

Overall, evidence suggests that up to one-fifth of health spending does not create value for the patient. With over 9% of GDP spent on health care systems across the OECD, such waste undermines the financial sustainability of our health systems, and more importantly, does not lead to better health for the patients. 

Almost half the population has a chronic disease, and many have two or more chronic conditions. The chronic conditions are responsible for a major part of the health care costs (in Sweden, 80-85%). We do not focus on diagnoses, but instead on symptoms, functions and quality of life. The important goal is to support patients to communicate their health in a better way. The patient should not have to use a different system for their diabetes, COPD or Depression, and try to think if e.g. their fatigue is due to one of these conditions. We need to support patients to communicate their symptoms in a better way, and give healthcare the resources to understand and help the patient.
In our model, the patient owns their data, and has the opportunity to share that data with different care providers, researchers, life-science companies and quality registers, through this the same data can be useful in many different areas. 

Symptoms Europe AB has performed market analyses, and now have four business areas and targets: Intelligence (for academia, life science, quality registries, health care payers); Clinic (hospital clinics or health centers can provide the service to all their patients, and have the possibility to follow the group of patients); Care (for healthcare providers – improving the individual meeting with the patient) and Diary (to support and empower the patient).

We develop 'lifestyle systems’ and the market's first AI-integrated hybrid watch that is designed to counter information overload. Our technology interprets and disperses information to only notify of what is subjectively relevant and important to the user. Our mission is to eradicate the abuse of digital communication to create a socially sustainable cyber life.

The market need is indicated by the fact that people receive an average of 64 notifications a day and only a fraction are relevant to the user. The ordinary functionality is static and delivers information regardless of the user's wishes and needs at any given moment, which impairs focus and causes stress. The notifications do not differ from one another regardless of severity and they are all based on sources instead of topics and people. We circumvent this inconvenience and offer a solution that ensures that the user never has to be distracted in vain.

Our solution is aimed at high-performing, social, and fashion-conscious men and women mainly in the ages 30-50, who highly benefit from saving time, remaining focused, and reducing screen-time and stress in everyday life.

THE FUTURE OF SMART PRODUCTS
We solve the problem with a watch that works as a digital ‘gatekeeper’ against irrelevant information rather than an extension to the mobile phone like regular smartwatches. The dynamic functions are based on the user's hierarchical values and micro-activities, which together with AI filtering and machine learning enable customized technology and a completely new type of smart functionality. 

 ★ STARTUP OF THE YEAR-FINALIST┃288 PRE-ORDERS IN 72 HOURS ★

The project has been developed for three years through a global network with competence from companies such as Fossil, Citizen, Hugo Boss, and Intel, and we have senior board members with experience managing 200MSEK-2BSEK companies.  The development is now being supported by Kronaby's co-founders and senior engineers Pål Borge and Sarandis Kalogeropulos. 

We develop our own app and watch movements with two years of smart battery life, and the development of the next generation has also begun which will be a body-heat-driven hybrid that enables life-long battery life. That development project will be carried out together with a Silicon Valley-based company focusing on thermoelectric energy.

  ★ FUNDING THROUGH VINNOVA┃5 INVESTORS IN 1ST SEED ROUND ★

WHY A WATCH?
○ It creates a physical barrier that deprioritizes the phone to limit screen time.
○ It is the ultimate product to optimize because of its accessibility. 
○ All competitors are counter-intuitive and contribute to the problem.
○ Integrating the app with a watch creates more opportunities for patents.
○ The margins in the watch industry are almost unbelievably high.
○ We love watches.

Entrepreneurship lets me look at life as a journey to fulfill my greatest wishes and desires, some that are related to the satisfaction in personal development but mostly my dream to give my family the fruits of life and to ultimately help and inspire the greater society.

We started Peepsplan to help people have better and more meaningful work experiences. The challenge was clear: with a massive burn-out pandemic and record-low employee engagement, we needed change. The advent of remote work as a new normal has only made this even more urgent.

Employee wellbeing, engagement and performance starts with the manager (or actually, starts and ends – 75% of everyone who leaves their job do so because of their manager). As managers, we have the opportunity and responsibility to help people grow, take active part in a team, and build a sense of achievement and belonging. Being a manager is often stressful and hard, but it’s also a privilege.

The good news is that being a good manager is not rocket science. It just takes good processes and consistency.

What Peepsplan is really about is democratizing good leadership by putting those processes in a simple and easy-to-use tool helping you remove distractions and start focusing on what’s most important while saving time rather than adding administration to your already busy schedule.

Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century according to WHO. This is reflected on healthcare systems across the globe, where pediatric obesity often is part of publicly provided healthcare. While studies have shown that bi-weekly follow-up is key to sustain a healthy weight loss, this is too costly and resource inefficient to offer for healthcare providers.

The  connection between acne and mental health is well established, impacting everything from self-image to social interactions.

In Sweden and the western world 50% have a chronic disease, and all chronic diseases are on the rise. Many of these conditions are connected to lifestyle factors. The healthcare system as we know it has a very small chance of curing these conditions. The reason for that is that they are only relieving symptoms, not treating the root cause of the disease. And all experts work separately in silos - no one is taking responsibility for the patient as a whole. We want to change this. 

With our method we want to find and treat the root cause of every health problem. We do so by a team based structure that uses a 360 degree analysis for all patients with chronic diseases, and by including lifestyle medicine in our treatment, helping them back to a healthy life (many free from medication). 

Every patient gets a health coach that helps and motivates them with lifestyle changes: nutrition and food, sleep, training, rest and reload and mental health. The program is done through the app and through digitalt meetings. The app is connected to wearables like apple watch or an Oura ring, and the patient logs their health status in a daily journal. A team of doctors, nutritionists and psychologists are ready for those who need extra support. 

2Heal Medical was started by doctors that were missing a method to help people with chronic disease get well, heal and stay healthy long term. The system didn't allow them to work with lifestyle changes, there was just no time - or knowledge for this! We have a physical clinic in Stockholm, and are now ready for the next step - help more people to heal!

Letting you experience what happened in the past according to historical records. Battles take place online and in scenarios on a turn based board. You will lead your forces to your enemies lines and holding your moral high you will dominate the fighting! This innovative game puts historical characters in cards moving combat on a grid format. The inspiration comes from: Magic, Civilizations, Age of Empires and Heroes.

It is also designed with a complete beginner in mind, so you don't need to know any programming to learn at CodeEasy. Each task has a set of automatic tests that run when our learners submit the solution. In such a way, each student at CodeEasy gets an immediate response regarding their solution, which makes the tutorial interactive and immediately puts newly learned skills into practice!

Systemet ska samla och underlätta integrationsarbetet kommunalt och privat genom att följa upp och kompetensutveckla nyanlända samt automatisera administrativa uppgifter och processer hos handläggare, coacher och lärare.

Dagens integrationsarbete är långt ifrån anpassat till verkligheten. Sverige och många andra länder i Europa har tyvärr inte hunnit anpassa sig efter den stora vågen av nyanlända under de senaste åren. Det leder dessvärre till att integrationsarbetet blir oerhört krångligt, kostsamt och ineffektivt.

Detta leder oss till lösningen på det stora problemet. Vi håller på att utveckla ett system som samlar hela integrationsarbetet under samma tak. Det vill säga SFI, samhällsorientering och stöd för vidare sysselsättning i Sverige. Systemet kommer att vara anpassat och fyllt av funktioner för deltagare befinnande i ett digitalt utanförskap eller analfabetism. Vårt arbete kommer resultera i att nyanlända har en och samma aktör att vända sig till gällande deras nya liv i Sverige. Kommuner, myndigheter och privata företag har ett verktyg som effektiviserar och automatiserar flera delar av deras dagliga arbetsprocesserna och administrativa uppgifter. Systemet automatiserar även den krångliga uppföljningen och dokumenteringen av nyanländas etablering.

Motivationen till vår satsning kom efter vår kartläggning av integrationsarbetet. Som då nyblivna gymnasiestudenter vart vi oerhört besvikna över hur vårt land hanterar resurser ineffektivt kopplat till integrationsarbetet. Vi såg även att integrationsarbetet sköttes mer eller mindre på samma sätt över hela landet och vi ansåg att vi kunde enkelt skapa ett system som täcker alla delar av integrationsarbetet nationellt.

We believe that Coding is for everyone and want to share this vision internationally. 
Kodarit's coding courses are fun and diverse. We teach programming skills, algorithmic thinking, game design and computer sciences in learning environments that are designed to be beginner-friendly. We highly value personalized teaching and this is why we keep our courses small (max. 10 participants).

Our vision is to offer good quality coding teaching all around the globe. Kodarit’s Founder and CEO, Suvi Syrjäläinen envisions an inclusive society in which coding is for everyone, despite their background, age, ethnicity or gender. As the world moves towards increasing digitalization, she has identified the need to make coding approachable for different groups in society. 
As a female CEO in the STEM branch, Suvi promotes the female inclusion in technology aiming to contribute in closing the gender gap. Kodarit’s services are now available in online, onsite and hybrid courses. As a next step we'll design our classes to fit areas without internet access. We'd like to help also developing countries moving towards more digitalized societies. Our contribution is to bring the best educational system in the world (Finland), combined with coding education, which will help our licensees to improve their and their student’s chances to be included in the global growth.

Here's the origin story. Back in 2018, two Danish colleagues (Jonas Bruun Jacobsen, CTO, and Frederik Rubens Steensgaard, CEO) were frustrated about how slow sustainability was developing in the world - firstly because of the dire and urgent need socially and environmentally, yet secondly also because of the needs economically from the market. The intentions and benefits seemed to be crystal clear from both supply and demand, yet something was keeping them from connecting. So we started the detective work, found out how painful finding and communicating sustainability information was, and surprisingly found virtually NO relevant platforms let alone any adequately addressing the pains. So we set out to build it. And yes we had the software and business acumen, but we wouldn't have gotten this ambitious innovation very far off the ground without the fantastic, diverse team who has blessed the mission with their wits, perspiration and heart.

BlueKey,Denmark,bluekey.ai,2020,1-10,Maritime & Transport,B2B,Pre-seed,"We help Dry Bulk shipping professionals calculate precise freight indications.

If you aren't familiar with any shipping lingo, that sentence probably makes little sense.

In a nutshell: Shipping is the backbone of global transport, usually categorised into three major industries: containers, liquid and dry shipping. The latter, also known as Dry Bulk, is by far the largest of them all.

Shipping 'offers' are made between the owner of the goods (needing transport) and the ship owners (the party which offers the transportation). The fastest and cheapest offer usually wins.

These offers are based on initial freight indications, which are constantly exchanged.

The Dry Bulk shipping industry, however, is notorious for being imprecise in its calculations and far behind when it comes to digitalisation.

Global decarbonisation efforts and shrinking profit margins are pushing the industry to its limits, forcing companies to utilize all available data, of which there are oceans (pun intended)!

This is where BlueKey comes in handy:

We've developed a search platform, which collects and indexes all kinds of data from multiple sources.

From public data sources (BlueKey Dry Bulk) to private, internal company data (BlueKey Corporate): this award-winning search engine allow ship owners, charterers and brokers to effectively make use of maritime data points (as well as internal operations data, in the case of BlueKey Corporate), which makes for faster and more accurate freight indications.

To put it in perspective: An experienced chartering manager usually calculates between 20 to 30 freight indications per day. Each calculation takes up to 20 to 30 minutes (and usually requires back-and-forth via phone and email to fetch precise numbers).

With BlueKey, the chartering manager is now able to calculate a precise freight indication in less than five minutes, without having to contact colleagues, port agents, fuel brokers, captains, and so on.

BlueKey is a search engine capable of finding port info, vessel status, real-time bunker prices, cargo movements, tools for efficient navigation, and more.

The platform is a 'one-stop-shop' complete with auto-completion, search predictions and even integrated tools for collecting and sharing the results.

We currently serve users from around the globe via our off-the-shelf BlueKey Dry Bulk solution, and we are (with the same technology) developing enterprise solutions (BlueKey Corporate) to customers in Japan, Singapore, Norway, Monaco and Denmark.

Nordic Startup School,Finland,nordicstartupschool.com,2019,1-10,Education,B2B,Seed,"Nordic Startup School aims to be the best program for pre-seed startups in Europe. 

While Tomi Terentjeff was living in US, he noticed that plenty of Finnish startups showed interest on US markets and were coming there to scout the market. Unfortunately, most of the startups were not prepared to enter the US market, since a lot of funding is required and startups need to be precise on what they are doing and what value it is provided to the customers. Nordic Startup School was then founded to improve the quality of startups and educate their founders to become the best possible entrepreneurs they can be because companies come and go, but founders stay around longer.

Nordic Startup School is based on values that we all believe in, centered on the “No assholes” rule. We make a long-term impact on startups and thus on society, but we do not compromise on our values for any amount of money. We want to be an example of inclusiveness, diversity, openness, and genuine cooperation.

We aim to be the “hippie VC”, as we have been nicknamed. We are professional and efficient yet chill since we understand that all is temporary and one day we will be dead, and rather do things we are passionate about than live in regret our beautiful existence.

Mangfold Forlags vision is to create caring, peaceful and diverse societies through developing and maintaining empathy in children.

Mangfold Forlag helps to teach and understand attitudes among both children and adults to break the generation cycle of not talking about &quot;the elephant in the room&quot;.  
The long-term focus is to build capacity of social / emotional competence for the next generation.   
In the short term,it focuses on increasing the level of empathy and curiosity, resulting in more respectful and caring relationships and reduced bullying. 
One and a half year ago, my son then 5years old,is watching tv while I make dinner.

&quot;Why this boy is sleeping on the beach&quot; he asks. The boy he is referring to is Aylan, 4 years old, refugee, that lies dead on shore. I felt scared to answer him, mainly because I did not want my son to feel the pain I feel every time I look at this picture. 
I searched for a children book at the library, internet, amazon, bookstores and organisations that works with refugees but found nothing. I even started looking for other tools that could help me start this difficult conversation like movie, or boardgame but again felt short.

The problem is that in a world that is rapidly changing rules and conflict arises the market lacks child-friendly tools for developing and maintaining children’s capacity of empathy,leadership,curiosity,belonging and teamwork, all essential skills for next generation changemakers. 
Siting down with the child and talk about the difficult topic, we help the children put the facts in order so the child do not carry a false perception of the situation, the child feels safe, it feels respected and bonds deeper. 
The above strategies supports directly six of the sustainable development goals. 
The idea was to make a book to the 500.00 children in Norway between the age 3 to 9. A crowdfunding campaign at funde.no where 350 people pre-ordered the book in order to print the book.

The next step was Reach For Change Norway that gave me the tools, the network and the time I needed to be ready to stand strong today as an social entrepreneur and winning the title Game Changer Leader 2017. 
Mangfold Forlag is creating tools that reflects reality in a child friendly way and let children experience another perons perspective.

The tools can be in any language and be used any country. 
My connection with my son is so much deeper because of Mangfold Forlag 

I hope I can do the same for every pre-school and every family across the globe.

We take viewers around the world and show them first hand how climate change is already bringing devastating challenges for the worlds most vulnerable communities. 

Fox Media Documentaries is a forward-thinking and pioneering Danish Documentary company based in central Copenhagen (Christianshavn). We work on developing artistic VR documentaries that have both an emotive and educational impact on audiences. Our newest venture, Biosphere VR ( www.biospherevr.com ), consists of five different cinematic VR-experiences that connect spectators with the climate change crisis through immersive technology. Each of the five experiences is seen through the eyes of a particular local individual (narrator) in Beijing, Jordan, Ethiopia, Kiribati and Morocco. See more here: https://www.biospherevr.com/#biosphere.

Each VR-experience runs between 5 and 10 minutes and engages audiences on a deeply personal and emotional level. Simultaneously, the five VR-experiences effectively tap into the fundamental consequences of global warming and provide clear and engaging educational content. These experiences have already received a significant commendation at many highly acclaimed international film festivals including VR Days, COP: DOX and Cinequest Film and VR.

In addition, Biosphere’s five individual VR experiences have so far been tested in two different educational institutions: Maglegaard School in Denmark, and Learning Lab at Tsinghua University in Beijing (China). Both tests have produced impressive results, with all spectators reporting an increased motivation for learning following their engagement with Biosphere VR. We have also conducted workshops in the US and at COP-summits.

For further information about our educational project, please visit ://www.biospherevr.com/introduction-in-the-school#new-page-35https.

In addition to the five existing experiences we have produced, we are interested in producing more stories in other parts of the world: including Germany, the Netherlands, the Arctic, among many others. We also intend to conduct more workshops in order to raise awareness of the climate change crisis, as well as to encourage and inspire more climate change initiatives. We are also looking to expand into museums and to conduct exhibitions.

Undervisningen er ambitiøs, men med masser af plads til udforske de lande, vi rejser til. Vi fokuserer undervisningen omkring kommunikation, journalistik og medier i bredest mulige forstand, og du får konkrete værktøjer og erfaringer, som du kan tage med videre i din uddannelse og dit arbejdsliv. Undervisningen foregår mellem kl. 9-13 på hverdage, vi holder undervisningsfri i weekenderne, og der er cirka to rejseuger på hvert højskoleophold, hvor du har mulighed for at rejse til nærliggende lande eller seværdigheder. På det fleste af vores destinationer er det også muligt at tage dykkercertifikat, lære at surfe eller at hakke andre ting af på din bucket list.

Højskolen er stiftet af Robin Juel Johansen, som blandt andet har arbejdet med journalistik om Afrika, kommunikation og kampagner for en lang række politiske organisationer og private virksomheder, og i en medieorganisation, som kæmper for frie mediers rettigheder i konfliktområder. Robin er drevet af nysgerrighed på verden, og brænder for at give dig oplevelser, som du tager med dig videre i livet. Højskolens øvrige undervisere deler samme passion for at udforske verden langt fra den danske andedam og har alle en stor passion for at tilrettelægge interessant og ambitiøs undervisning.

We do so by working with dedicated local partners in low-income countries around the world that help kids learn through effective learning initiatives. Our geographical focus right now is Nepal, where we are supporting 3 local partners.

Our operating costs are covered by a group of private individuals, which means we can send 100% of all other donations directly to the field. We call it the 100%-promise.

Moonbound Oy,Finland,moonbound.fi,2021,1-10,Education,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Moonbound Oy is crafting learning experiences for tomorrow's explorers.

We are building a gamified video learning platform, Skilli.io.

The current linear video learning platforms do not support the non-linearity of learning and human need for autonomy in the best way possible. Furthermore, displaying the course content linearly fails to communicate how different subskills are connected to each other. 

We aim to make learning skills more engaging and deeply motivating by gamifying the learning process. The skill or art, be it photography, skateboarding or cooking, is broken down into short learning videos and challenges. The progress in the learning process is portrayed in a skill tree – rather than a linear row of videos – familiar from many video games. Teachers are carefully selected to be the most renowned in their fields. The end product is an Android & iOS app and a website.

Currently we are at the idea phase prototyping the concept.

We are located at Epicenter co-working space in the heart of Helsinki.  Location FinlandWebsite moonbound.fiFounded 2021Employees 1-10Industries EducationBusiness model B2CFunding state Bootstrapping",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Milton universe uses a mix of different technologies to enhance the children’s learning capabilities. The captivating and attention-grabbing storytelling is a mix of facts, fun and fairytales. Milton’s stories communicate the significant topics with simplicity and a positive spin.

With the complete educational packages for the UN’s 17 Global Goals, Milton Around the World© is a solid platform, all wrapped in a recognizable structure that requires little preparation. 

Using Learning Enhancing Technologies, all delivered on a modern digital platform, our learning material is bringing the simplicity of the complex topics to the children. We also give the teachers and parents a source so they can explain the topics as Milton’s stories and education kits encourage dialogue between the children, teachers and parents. 

The Milton universe is built for global use, shown both via written words and colorful vivid illustrations. The Danish founders, have an international background with understanding and respect of other cultures and an outspoken ability to embrace diversity. Milton is already known and liked in Denmark, India, US, China, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Being a unique first mover on communicating complexed topics in a structured way to children, we discovered a market need, resulting in the creation of the Milton universe, fitted perfect to ensure presence of appropriate material for the children.

Students can also find tips from former students, learn more about daily life in the new country, and discover local gems, only other students know about. We are also running a weekly live broadcast where students can engage in a conversation about current events in the country and the world.

We provide people with information that is crucial to a successful and happy life in Denmark. And we make sure that the information is correct, easy to understand, and actionable. We are making sure that we include the community, answer questions that people are asking, and touch on topics, which most other publicly funded organizations cannot.

After a successful year on the market, we have learned how to communicate key information in an effective way, either through videos, articles or live streams. After our platform grew, we understood from peoples feedback that they needed a strong sense of community. Therefore, we are organizing weekly meetings in Aarhus, where all like-minded students can meet and work together on common goals.

We have developed the project to it’s near full-market potential. We are present on all key platforms where the target group is and we have established an organizational structure that is recruiting more members. We are technologically capable to execute large projects and collaborations.

We are part of AU Incubator since 2019, where we have held conversations with startup advisors. Consequently, we are using AU Incubator as a meeting point for the community that builds Student Survival Guide.
Student Survival Guide is run by Michael Mares and Jaroslav Vyhnak, both 24 year old Master’s Degree Students in Economics and Business Administration at Aarhus University in Denmark. However, Student Survival Guide is a community-run project where a key asset are the contributors that write and share their knowledge. 

The contributor can be anyone with experience of the Danish way of life and schooling. So far, SSG has had more than 20 contributors. All of the contributors are bachelor’s/master’s degree students from international backgrounds.
Contributors form teams that are responsible for various areas of the project, such as blogging, social media, video editing, news research and community management. All of the teams have their respective managers, who collaborate together to ensure proper project development.

We have so far been able to reach more than 100,000 people through social media, gained more than 5,000+ followers on social media and got our videos viewed more than 43,000 times. On top of this, more than 10,000 students have already read our blogs and ‘survival guides’ to Denmark, on our website.

High value communities: Professionally organised Industrial and innovation ecosystems; large business and expert networks; peer-to-peer and patient support networks with business critical content and sensitive personal data. 

The Problem: Building and engaging high-value communities is difficult without a digital platform. Community members need high quality experience, while data protection hygiene and compliance is not optional for e.g public institutions in EU. Terms and conditions, IPR-, and data ownership are unresolved issues on most community platforms, as the true value creation in the community is owned by the platform provider.

The Solution: Mesensei offers everything high-value communities need to design, develop, and operate their own GDPR compliant community platforms under their own brands and data controllership.

With Mesensei, the customers can also deploy immediately their own mobile applications and at a fraction of a cost of traditional software development.

MakeImpact,Denmark,makeimpact.io,2018,11-50,Fintech,B2B,Bootstrapping,"The Pitch
We help generate positive societal impact by changing people’s financial behavior.

The What
According to the UNCTAD (UN Conference on Trade and Development) World Investment Report from 2014, the total annual investments in SDG-relevant sectors in developing countries will need to be between $3.3 trillion and $4.5 trillion in order to meet the SDGs by 2030. Such estimates mean there is an annual financing gap of $2.5 trillion between current funding and what is required.
The public sector is already doing a lot but to close this large gap, will require a major investment of resources from many actors, particularly from the private sector. The capital is already there. What’s needed is for that capital to find a home in well-designed, viable projects.

In order to move this capital, the private sector will need to take financial action. People have the desire to take action but need help to do so. This is where MakeImpact will play an important role – helping people who want to make a difference through impact investing. 


The How
We believe that there are 3 ways to help change people’s financial behavior in order to create a substantial positive societal impact

Through Education: 
The more you know about making a positive impact, the better suited you are to actually do it.

Through Investing: 
In order to help close the SDG financing gap with the use of private capital, investing your money in sustainable companies that work for a better future is the way forward.

Through Tracking of Investments: 
Tracking your investments and becoming aware of which investments are sustainable or not will make you want to learn more about other companies that have a sustainable agenda and thereby re-educating yourself and potentially making more impact investments.

In order to achieve the greatest behavioral change, these 3 will all need to be tied together – allowing people, in the best way possible, to change their financial behavior towards a better societal impact


The Why
We saw a need to help the non-investors getting started on their impact investing journey using the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework.

The team currently consists of 17 passionate, innovative and purpose-driven people that help building a solution where the non-investor can use their money to make an impact in the world.

Skills to the Future,Finland,skillstothefuture.com,2021,1-10,Education,Marketplace,Bootstrapping,"Skills to the Future, is developing a digital learning platform to help schools to provide supplementary STEM courses in topics where they lack the resources or competence.

We think that our present education could be better.  Now the content comes more from looking in the rear mirror, than through the windshield.  It should take better account of the constant acceleration of our living environment.  We want to help the schools to provide our youth education that trends to the future as much as possible.  We cannot exactly tell what skills in 10 years are needed, but we can make good guesses and at least show them in the right direction.  

Our obligation is to give our youth a kick and a spark starting to learn new skills for the future.
How we differentiate ourselves from the other course providers? Our pillars 4 are:

#1   The quality of pedagogy first

We align, curate, and orchestrate all our course material to achieve pedagogic competence and meet the quality requirements of the ‘Finnish Education Standards’.

#2   The how:  Blended project-based learning with a flipped approach

Digital courses mostly rely only on the delivery of educational material.  Our digital platform relies on blended open-ended project-based learning with a flipped approach.  That means that also we deliver the educational material online but that’s only one-half of what we do.  We also deliver teacher/educator lead workshops, Q&As.  We want to ensure that the student really can utilize the information given and convert that to skills by practicing aka by doing homework. Just watching videos and answering some quizzes gives you the illusion you have now learned a skill!

#3   High impact needs high completion rates

By following and complying with the Finnish pedagogical guidelines we aim to raise the completion rate from Udemy like under 10% to over 80%.  A raise in engagement is achieved also with help from our 4th pillar.

#4   Co-operating and collaborating with the schools

We aim to co-operate with the schools by trying to include our courses in each school’s learning curricula and embed them in the school’s teaching environment.  We also aim to collaborate with schools by co-creating courses on topics they want.

Searching co-workers with a calling

I have been working on this project for a couple of years quite loosely.  Soon, when the Helsinki Education Hub starts and opens its doors, we are applying to the EdTech Incubator program. So now is the time to onboard and start the cruise, isn’t it?

A person on my wish list for co-founders and early team members could be:

-	a teacher, educator, course builder, or at least be interested in or somewhat familiar with pedagogy.  Curating the courses would be one of the tasks

-	a tech guy who would run and tackle the Learning Management System or Virtual Learning Environment in all its complexities

-	a hacker, data guy, designer, or whoever who would join testing and building the product/service in the right direction and helping it grow

-	an audio/video person who would be in building the courses and participating in the marketing activities broadly understood
-	a content provider because we are going to build ourselves only some MVP’s

-	there are many other jobs and tasks you could do, so practically anyone who is self-motivated is welcomed to join!

My primary target is to have an impact on my activities. Even though money helps in living, I would rather make a ding in the education universe than get wealthy.

I prefer diversity in age, gender, and nationality and I am searching for like-minded people who want to share my calling.

I am not inviting you to join right away.  Working as a co-founder is like marriage, you just can’t quit when you feel like it.  Therefore, it’s best for both parties just to make a small project together and after the experiment, we know how we like to proceed.

A digital wallet to which parents will top up childrens allowence and children will get the money in their digital wallets when they use educational applications in their phones.

“Lapee gives women and people who need to pee squatting a quick, safe and hygienic way out.”

Urinals for men have been around for a long time, but women and people who need to pee squatting have been long overlooked. For them the need to relieve themselves in public, at events or at festivals always comes with great difficulty. The lines for closed toilet cabins are always long and only two other options present themselves: going without peeing or finding an improvised and unsafe place to pee. Both are highly problematic and degrading. Lapee is a simple solution to a long standing example of gender inequality; Lapee gives women and people who need to pee squatting a quick, safe and hygienic way out.

Behind this idea of developing peeing equality are Gina (FR) and Alexander (DK), two architects who graduated from the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen in Spring, 2017. They were working as architects for the famous Roskilde Festival when they thought and developed Lapee.

Today, Lapee is available for rent in 20 countries through 30 partners.

Lack of consumer info and a large intention action gap slow the shift towards sustainability and equality and leave the individual stranded. We are about to change that. 

Gokind uses open banking to introduce a frictionless way for a consumer to be guided and rewarded when supporting like minded brands. A loyalty program that resonates with each user. 

🌴 Living sustainable made easy
By combining sustainability data with the user’s own values and transaction data, we create a hyper personalized experience, eliminating the threshold for the user to screen and choose brands that match its values. We provide the user with incentives and a one swipe away solution to change to more sustainable providers (be it utilities, insurance, e-commerce, banks, foodstuff).

💼 Next gen. B2C.
For our B2C-partners it is a new way to transact and build loyalty with Generation Z and Y. Instead of a myriad of vendor loyalty programs without cause and low retention, we are gathering brands that want to communicate with its consumers on a deeper level.

Open banking based loyalty programs have proven more than 3x efficiency over digital marketing alternatives (with ROAS as high as 30x). It’s powerful stuff. 

Our solution is a disruption of the traditional loyalty market, a $170bn global market, and acts as an efficient supplement to digital marketing/affiliate marketing and traditional B2C market research solutions.

🍀 Impact.
Delivering proof to our community, partners and future investors on our impact performance is key. But it requires great data. Our combined sustainability and spending data will enable us to deliver razor sharp proof to our stakeholders on how we nudge consumers and partners in the right direction. Quite unique.

SHIFT sells beautiful jewelry that with tiny technology inside doubles as a safety device. When pressed, it calls for backup through the SHIFT app.

More importantly SHIFT engages and motivates all, but primarily men and boys to be a pivotal part of the solution as backups in order to shift the culture and deal with the root cause.

With SHIFT you straighten your back when walking down the street. Your troubled eyes change to looking strong and empowered. You wear what you like, you walk where you like, you do what you like - at the time you like. You are just you.

This is not caused by wearing a SHIFT symbol - it is just a symbol. You do this because finally somebody is taking you seriously, somebody is doing something about what stopped you from living your life. Now, you are  part of a movement that doesn't only want this for you - but for all girls and women on a global scale.

A movement that holds men and boys accountable and guides them to be part of the solution. The weight lifted from your shoulders to be considerate, be careful, be less, be more, makes you tall, shine and feel beautiful. It is now clear who's the loser in the power game that harassers and abusers are playing.

Of course, there are no garanties. SHIFT is not a security service, nor an insurance. However, now you know how to act and you know that thousands of others are standing right behind you. The more you talk about SHIFT, the more shares, the more symbols, the more impact, the higher likability that a shift in culture will happen.

*PROBLEM*
All food-related businesses need to deal with physical supply-chain assets, which are hard and expensive to scale and also have an immense negative impact on the value propositions towards buyers. Specifically for catering buyers, this results in keeping them trapped in a captive market with uniform and interchangeable offerings within a single supplier and across suppliers.

*SOLUTION*
Gastronaut is a catering company with a radical business model that scales physical assets with the same ease, speed and cost as scaling software, while also improving the value chain. Specifically, we develop and coordinate a proprietary network of independent cloud kitchens (fundamentally different from other dark-kitchen models) to produce a complex catering service for a single buyer, and a single cloud kitchen to produce simultaneously for multiple buyers.

Gastronaut's model allows for:
- 9x higher margins than any caterer,
- 2,5x higher margins than food-mediating/aggregating platforms,
- in the consumer-facing food market with the highest AOV (catering)
- while offering buyers the only award-winning and premium experience at mid-range prices.

*POSITIVE IMPACT*
Gastronaut partners only with talented immigrant chefs who bring specialised craftsmanship and sophisticated flavours exclusively from their home countries. This enables us to create jobs, integration opportunities and economic sustainability for immigrants to achieve breadth and depth of impact. This CSR credit is fully transferable to our clients without them paying or doing anything extra. Last, but not least, in this male-dominated industry 80% of Gastronaut chefs are women.

Goodtalks,Denmark,goodtalks.dk,2018,1-10,Service,"B2C, B2B",Pre-seed,"About
Goodtalks is a professional digital network for woman. The platform supports woman in building a strong network they can draw upon to advance their career. Our goal is gender equality in leadership roles and management boards  – to the benefit of the individual, corporations and society at large.

The What
SDG 5: gender equality 
Despite the fact that it’s recognised more women in top management has a positive impact on the bottom line, gender equality in Danish leadership roles and management boards leaves a lot to be desired. 
With 27% of woman in leadership positions Denmark is the lowest ranking of the Nordic countries and even below the OECD average of 31%.1 
When it comes to corporate and board management numbers are even lower. In 2018 the proportion of women in top management was 13% and board management 17% , and the trend is decreasing. For instance only one of the C25 listed companies has a female CEO.
One challenge is that candidates to fill top leadership positions are recruited via network and since these are male ‘heavy’ it creates a vicious circle that takes effort to interrupt.1 
Goodtalks address the network issue that prevent women from landing top management positions by offering a platform where woman can build strong alliances and get support to grow their career.

The How
Goodtalks offer professional women a digital platform that allows them to build and strengthen their network across roles, functions and businesses. 
It works as an exchange of experiences and knowledge, which given the digital format removes barriers by making help, sparring and sharing easily available.
In addition the setup encourages honest exchange of both good and challenging experiences, which serve to fuel our members with needed competencies and courage to advance their career. 
Further members are regularly offered the opportunity to meet in person at live events where they network and listen to two inspiring speakers (e.g. CEO’s and politicians) who share the unglossy version of their career stories.

The Why
Spending many years in Corporate World, Pernille who established Goodtalks, would at times find herself in organisations that had a deep negative impact on her mood and wellbeing. So much so that she would bring the tension home and take it out on her family. Searching for an explanation (and solution) a pattern emerged. Business where she had struggled to thrive all had a lack of female competencies in leadership roles and management boards in common. An imbalance that affected the entire organisation. A deep desire to facilitate balanced organisation via gender equality and change this dynamic took root. Pernille identified community as a key leaver to achieve this. An environment where women can meet up online and offline to share experiences and support each others growth. She also recognised that in order for the sharing to be relatable and have a transformational impact it had to be honest and ‘unglossy’. Soon after Goodtalks was launched.

We are a safe and sustainable adult entertainment platform and social network with extensive  educational and support resources. 

Momentarily, sex education is inadequate, and therefore, we all turn to the internet and pornography to explore. But existing platforms are ripe with violence and abuse. We then copy these violent and abusive behaviors in our own sex lives. At the same time, adult performers also face insecurity and uncertainty. Shunned by society, they do not have anyone protecting their rights and instead have to fear being kicked off and being mistreated by platforms and users. This leaves an enormous amount of mostly female-sex workers in precarious positions, having to comply with anything these platforms or users demand. 

Freyja is going to change all of this. We work with charities and non-profits to make sure we protect users and performers. We pre-moderate content to abolish racist, violent and abusive content.

First of all, like most investors, we are in continuous conversations with our network. Sometimes you want to know what’s moving in the market while other times you need to discuss a case with field experts. If you have decided to invest you often want to promote the deal and find good co-investors.



Secondly we encourage having a systematic approach to evaluate startups in order to eliminate decisions based on gut feeling and unconscious bias.



Our software aims to solve these two problems, and is designed to be an easy-to-use tool for investors to use on the go, and to lower the threshold for curious investors-to-be to enter the market.



We currently have a working MVP in production that is being used by a handful of pilot customers. Our goal for the next four months is to work closely with these, participate in their events and courses, and shape Notata around their needs.

In the Western world we consume up to 10 hours of media every day - news, Netflix, social media, you name it. Through this media we are shown a biased image of the world - for example, only 30% of speaking roles in cinema movies globally are given to women, and only 1% of characters in movies have functional limitations. This of course affects our view of the world, teaching us biases and contributing to an unsustainable world of discrimination and segregation.

At the same time, national and international governmental bodies in the media industry are focusing very hard on exactly these issues. Just like in other industries, authorities like the European Broadcasting Union and national public service regulators are looking at the UN sustainability goals and trying to find ways to increased gender equality (goal no. 5) and decreased inequalitites (goal no. 10). 

Research shows that 80% of movie and TV audiences want to change the state of diversity in media and entertainment. ""Newcomers"" like Netflix continue to steal audiences with norm-breaking series showing a different picture of the world - one that includes a diversity of stories and people.

At Ceretai we have made it our mission to support the media industry in creating more diversity in their content. We have built a SaaS solution, the Diversity Dashboard, that automatically analyses any given media file for gender and age representation, and we continue to develop it to cover more grounds for discrimination. We also provide services for creating awareness and fostering change within European media organisations, for example workshops and reports.

The idea that became Ceretai was sparked in late 2017, in the wake of the Me Too campaign, when the founders grew tired of not finding entertainment that matched their values. Realising how unconsciously biased we all are, the company was founded in early 2018 with the idea of building an automated tool for detecting norms and stereotypes in popular culture. Our mission has stayed the same: contributing to a more equal and tolerant world by using technology to create awareness and change.

Lifeplanner AS,Norway,lifeplanner.no,2018,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS","B2C, B2B",Seed,"Problemet

I løpet av et helt liv samler vi enorme mengder data og informasjon som er viktig for oss.
Alt fra vitnemål, arbeidskontrakter, leieavtaler, skjøte, bankforbindelser, forsikringer, testament, fødselsattest, helsekort mm. Problemet for mange er at det kan være vanskelig å holde oversikt.  Noe er lagret i ringpermer, noe i skuffer, noe på e-post, og annet i filer eller dropbox'er.
Den dagen du trenger akkurat det ene viktige dokumentet, kan du være sikker på at det er helt umulig å huske hvor du har lagret det. 
Mange opplever også at det kan være vanskelig å få oversikt over denne informasjonen for sine nærmeste den dagen en av dem blir rammet av alvorlig sykdom eller ved bortgang. 

Solution

Ved å koble seg opp mot offentlige og private kilder, kan LifePlanner med ditt samtykke laste ned og strukturere all denne informasjonen for deg slik at du har alt samlet på ett sted - lett tilgjengelig når du trenger det.
Ved hjelp av en enkel delingsfunksjon kan du også dele ønsket informasjon med dine nærmeste slik at de får tilgang dersom uhellet skulle være ute.

Customers

LifePlanner kan være relevant for svært mange ulike personas. Felles for dem er at de har et behov for å få oversikt over alle dokumenter, informasjon osv om seg og sin familie. Fremfor en typisk personasprofil, vil Lifeplanner være relevant i ulike livshendelser som f. eks.
- flytte hjemmefra
- etablere familie
- jobbskifte
- reise
- end of life
- ulykker
- sykdom

Competitors

Vi ser et markedsvindu som ikke er ordentlig betjent, hverken i Norge eller i mange andre europeiske land. Nærmest et ""Blue Ocean"".

Det betyr IKKE at det ikke finnes konkurranse, men den konkurransen er fragmentert og lite helhetlig. Det er mange som tilbyr små deler av kundens liv, gjerne deler som er knyttet opp mot deres egne produkttilbud. Det ser vi f.eks hos advokater, begravelsesbyråer og til og med i offentlig sektor.

I USA ser vi at det finnes aktører som ligner på LifePlanner. De baserer seg hovedsakelig på manuell datainnhenting. Så vidt vi kan se viser de liten interesse for det europeiske markedet, de har tilsynelatende mer enn nok med å betjene det amerikanske markedet.

CleanCup AS,Norway,cleancup.no,2018,1-10,Healthcare & Life Science,B2C,Bootstrapping,"CleanCup's on a mission to empower people with periods through high quality products and information. 

Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. They need safe period products, and disposable products just won't do anymore. 

Let’s be honest;  Tampons suck.  No, really, they do!

Both literally and figuratively. 

Tampons absorb period blood, but it does not differentiate it from your body's natural moisture, and it absorbs that too, which can cause infections and skin irritation. 

And besides: We use 11 000 disposable period products each, causing tons of cotton and plastic waste. 

One tampon takes than 100 years to degrade; this means all of the tampons you have ever used are still in our environment somewhere. 

Pads and tampons are not really comfortable, practical, sustainable, or even cheap. It’s just what’s been available.

Do we want this as a legacy for our planet and our kids?

No. But we have the solution: CleanCup. The Norwegian menstrual cup. Uniquely designed for comfort. Designed in collaboration with hundreds of women.

We have a vision for Better workplaces, workplaces where people are motivated and empowered. 
Changing the way we work means changing how we do things but also how we think about work. 
We identify 3 key areas where we can affect change for the Better.
 - Learning
 - Goals
 - Inclusivity

Learning
Promoting learning for the sake of learning is key to our ideology.
 - Employee motivation goes up from getting to explore and expand their skills and knowledge.
 - New skills are developed in that could prove useful in a future project or product.
 - Expanding your knowledge and skill will benefit performance in non-direct and often intangible ways.

Goals
Goals should be Attainable, Realistic, and stemming from the right Motivation.
Attainable
 - To allow goals to be reached and to instill confidence in the people working towards it.
 - To set ourselves up for success 
Realistic
 - To be honest with ourselves about what we can accomplish
 - To adjust to changing circumstances and new information
Right Motivation
 - To allow consistency of effort  

Inclusivity
Our Products, and our culture should be inherently inclusive. 
This idea encompasses accessibility : building products that anyone can use.
 - And goes beyond : building products that everyone can feel was built with them in mind.
 - We want to consciously address the inherent bias that is built into so many of the processes and products that exist in the workplace.

Global demand for particle free water is growing at an ever-increasing pace due to the rise in global R&D expenditure and growing demand from semiconductor industries and life science.
The cost for ultrapure water is rising and also affect the enviroment in a negative way. 
The amount of water used in the semiconductor industry is equal to the amount of water used by a small city during a year. 
Also chemicals are added making the water harmful to release back into nature! 

The need to reduce the amoun of water and chemicals needed is higher then ever before AND also increasing the purity level of the water.

NSS Water Enhancement Technology has the solution.
WET (Water Enhancement Tool) can produce nanopure water totally free of ANY contaminations above 5-10 nanometers, our nanopure water is 1000 times more pure then todays type 1 water AND the use of water in a semiconductor factory can be reduced with up to 90%. 

This is a NANOPURE WATER REVOLUTION. 
_________________________________________________________

Tomorrow,-,tmrow.com,2016,-,Energy & Greentech,B2C,-,"The Pitch
Tomorrow is a tech startup building an app that automatically computes the carbon footprint of your daily activities, and gives you mean to compensate for your emissions.

The What
Citizens care about climate change, but don’t know how to act. They ask what they personally can do to fight climate change, and find it’s too cumbersome to understand their emissions and to compensate for them.
The existing solution is simply to cumbersome: to compensate for emissions, one has to manually enter all activities into a carbon calculator, or to use an estimated value which is not precise enough. 

The How
We're building an app that automatically computes the carbon footprint of your daily activities.
It does so by connecting to third parties to reach the history of activities performed by the user. For example, by connecting to emails, we can retrieve the list of flights from the receipts. By connecting to Uber, we can retrieve the list of Uber trips.
We're building an open source community of people helping us build all those integrations.
Furthermore, we want to make it easy for users to expense work-related emission compensations to their employer

The Why
We're doing this because there's a high demand from people around us to act more sustainably and to understand their footprint. As climate change is the most challenging problem of our time, we're here to build the single source of truth for carbon information based on an open movement.

Brighteco AB,Sweden,brighteco.se,2011,1-10,Energy & Greentech,B2B,Series A,"The Pitch
We accelerate the shift to a more sustainable whole through circular economy. 

The What
Sustainable habitats make heavy demands, for example, on planning, construction and management of both new and pre-existing settlement. Quality, knowledge and competence in the construction industry have a very important part to play in this connection. Housing and commercial premises account for roughly 30% of Sweden’s end use of energy and for about 7% of its total emissions of greenhouse gases. Electricity accounts for nearly half the sector’s energy use, followed by district heating (30%) and biofuels (10%)


The How
We are in the business of Enlightenment. Brighteco sells light as a continuous deployment service (LaaS). The customer pays to access the right light in the right place in exchange for an annual fee/sqm. 
All our products can therefore be individually adjusted and updated over time, and manufactured on recycled hardware without harm to the environment. A close relationship with the customer creates opportunities to use our infrastructure to create services related to security, information (gathering and communication) and facility management.

• System of continuous deployment of hardware
and service
• Light sources that can be upgraded and adjusted
• Recycled old flat screens as hardware
• Integrating IoT
Brighteco drives ideas and projects aimed at effectively maximizing the income from private and public sector activities in the short and long term. We do this by gradually adapting production, use and / or disposal of goods or services to the concept of sustainable development.

The Why
Since 2018, there is an ongoing shift in the Swedish market from buying lamps as a product to subscribing to Light as a service. Bollnäs Kommun (municipality) was the first public purchaser in Sweden, focusing on the aspects of light and sustainability at a larger scale, choosing Brighteco as their supplier. The contract is for 10 years, installation in classrooms is ongoing.

Meili Robots,Denmark,meilirobots.com,2019,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS, Manufacturing, Science & Engineering, Robotics, IoT",B2B,Pre-seed,"Meili FMS is a fleet manager for mobile robots with a vendor-agnostic approach. It enables operators to collate their diverse fleet onto one platform. By using Meili FMS, our users can finally use their mobile robot fleet to its full potential by orchestrating their fleet as a collective, regardless of the robot’s application, brand, or type. 
 
Our main mission is to eliminate interoperability pain points that have started to cast a shadow over the robotics industry. With more businesses adopting robots to carry out inventory management, material handling, and other applications, fleets are becoming more diverse.
Robot manufacturers can hardly keep up with this growing demand, which means that companies will be deploying robots from various brands — with different operating systems. This is where the problem arises. 

Currently, robot manufacturers develop their own FMS, which means minimal to no correlation between systems. In other words, the robots cannot communicate amongst each other, causing delays in operations, accidents, and collisions — ultimately increasing operation costs while diminishing safety and efficiency substantially. Frightfully, this problem may cripple the whole supply chain, with business owners starting to question their decisions on expanding operations with robots — as a result, stagnating the entire mobile robot market. 

There is a need for a universal third-party solution that can bridge the gap and enable seamless operation for the robots to function collectively rather than individually. At the same time, by having an overview of the whole fleet, robot management becomes much more effective. And that’s where we come in, with several important features: automated traffic control, smart task allocation algorithms, operator analytics, and unified mapping. 

With Meili FMS’s automated traffic control feature, robots in the same environment will operate in a safer and more organised manner — not only between individual robots but also between them and human-operated vehicles.

Too often do robots navigate the facilities without a payload as the current solutions do not facilitate task queuing effectively, therefore wasting energy by needless travel or lengthy idle time. Using smart tasking algorithms, Meili FMS can help improve companies’ sustainability records as the robot fleets will no longer operate without a payload and wasting any energy. 

Furthermore, our pricing plans are very accessible to early-stage or small businesses. This will definitely lower the entry barriers, allowing businesses of any size to start investing in robots and automation, which facilitates the growth of the robotics industry.

ROICO Solutions ApS,Denmark,roicosolutions.com,2022,1-10,Robotics,B2B,Pre-seed,"At ROICO Solutions we are developing a collaborative painting robot working alongside painters boosting productivity (+38.1%), reducing physical strain, and addressing labour shortage on the construction site. We focus on ease-of-use with a plug-and-play design for increased mobility and flexibility.

We experienced ourselves how challenging and physically demanding it was to paint. This made us curious to figure out what construction painters are faced with. It was due to this where learned that painters are in desperate need of new solutions to work faster, better, and healthier. We learned that over 50% of painters are open to adopting new technologies and 16% want it now. Moreover:
- Painters have the lowest margins in construction
- 86% of painting companies experience an increasing skilled labour shortage
- 33% of all EU painters will retire within a decade, while labour shortage increases

We aim to solve these issues  with Aacollaborative, semiautonomous robotic painting solution for construction painters. Our solution:
- Paints walls and ceilings up to 3.5 meters high using an extendable pillar;
- Navigates autonomously along walls through a mobile base;
- Object detection to recognize areas that should not be painted (e.g. windows or sockets);
- Uses sensors to detect any obstacles or people to avoid collisions;
- Mobile application allows manual control or semi-autonomous mode
- Software and sensors gather data (e.g. wall type, objects on the wall and ceiling, paint consumption, activity timer, and data associated with navigation and mapping

It all started with our own experiences painting. And when we learned how challenging it is for painting professionals, we knew that we wanted to make their lives easier. We set out to develop a tool using robotic technology that empowers painters.

It is the resource that we value the most, and at the same time, most people consider to be short of. Shopping for necessary everyday products is low on most people's priority list of what we wish to spend our time on. 

As much as 89% of Sweden's population are online shoppers, where pharmacy and beauty products are among the top three most common products to buy online. A total of 74% of the online shoppers do so to save time. So why do we insist on wasting time planning for and buying the same everyday products - over and over again? 

Subscriby enables online shoppers to save time by subscribing to their favourite everyday products. Simply buy the product from an online store where Subscriby is an option when going to the check out. Subscriby will then create a subscription of that specific product, to no extra cost for the consumer.  You can also use the Subscriby app to find products you want to subscribe to, through links to online stores. 

At Subscriby, we understand that no customer is like the other. And that is why the subscriptions are tailor made to meet each individual need. You choose the frequency, delivery and payment option that suits your needs.  You can see and manage all your subscriptions in the app or website, allowing for you to have full flexibility and control.  

In addition to saving time, Subscriby enables customers to make sustainable choices, e.g. subscribing to ecological products or the low plastic options, like refills, instead of the urgent purchases that can happen when you suddenly run out of something.  

At Subscriby, we want to change the traditional way of shopping for everyday products, so that valuable time can be spent on other things. So stop wasting your time, and join Subscriby so we can all start subscribing today!

NORDKONCEPT,Denmark,nordkoncept.dk,2021,1-10,Fashion & Living,B2C,Pre-seed,"Jumpsuits are one of the most popular fashion items in the world competing with dresses. The number one reason, mostly, women decide not to wear a jumpsuit is the lack of their functionality. Dressing, undressing, adding or removing one layer is impossible without removing all your clothing. If you've ever worn a jumpsuit, you know how challenging it is to use the restroom, or remove a layer when it's too hot; especially when you decide to wear a blazer or jacket on top.

To solve this problem, we created the Zip-on jumpsuit. The top and bottom pieces of this garment are attached through a zipper that goes all around the waist. This improvement allows you to easily remove only one piece at a time. The pieces can be replaced with other styles, for example if you replace the pants with a skirt, the piece becomes a dress, the most popular choice there is. 

We bring practicality to fashion, without compromising on style. We focus on quality and circularity. An important aspect we focus on is fitting and sizing. Our sizing allows for sizes S-M and M-L to share the same measurement at the waist, for maximising the fitting range of women in the current time. Our jumpsuits are made out of qualitative organic fabrics, made by fairly treated workers.

Our business is feasible and scalable.
Our Zip-On jumpsuit is practical, comfortable and modular. It is One piece, but two.

Ariia,Denmark,ariia.uk,2014,1-10,Fintech,"B2B, B2G",Bootstrapping,"Money laundering is a growing societal problem that annually costs Danish society between 34-59 billion or 1.7-2.9% of GDP. Besides the cost side of that, it creates a great inequality and leads to corruption which undermines society as a whole. Today the money laundering problem is rapidly increasing as the number of wanted individuals have been rising exponentially.

ARIIA is a fintech company that develops an innovative IT solution to fight money laundering and financial crime. This solution enables banks and AML (Anti Money Laundering) regulated companies to ensure that they are not facilitating or involved directly or indirectly in such affairs. The three founders behind ARIIA are specialists within the AML sector and financial services. They have a proven track record of successful start-ups in financial services. 

ARIIA’s solution brings value via: 
1. Compliance
Ensuring that our customers comply with all the requirements set by the authorities in money laundering legislation. 
2. Savings
Providing additional savings by removing unnecessary expenses to run vendor systems on client’s premises using legacy rules engines. 
With ARIIA there is no maintenance, no fine-tuning, no solutions experts required. Our tool is cloud-based, ensuring all data protection best practices (encryption, data catalogue, etc.)
3. Business growth
- up to 60% reduction in KYC cycle time
- up to 70% cut in Case Resolution time
- up to 50% reduction in False Positive hits
Such efficiency boosts will improve customer experience and will free up resources for further business development.
4. Safeguard and peace of mind. 
Protecting from fines and reputational risks in an absolutely new level. 
With our cutting edge technologies we are able to uncover complex business structures that mask criminals or compromised individuals' participation, obscure connections, facilitation schemes and much more. 

Our cutting edge technologies:
Central Knowledge Graph. 
The traditional method of screening is to make “lookups” vs sanction and watch lists. 
However the world is about connections and relationships. Our Central Knowledge Graph is a whole connection´s universe where we analyze companies and owners using interactive visual network. 
Interconnected Single Data Lake.
Traditional approach is to work with siloed datasets that are updated one by one (often manually). We process many databases (bank data, public data, sanction lists, etc.) in a data model, which makes it possible to find far more contexts and connections vs traditional approach.  
And web crawlers that run 24/7 pulling the most recent up-to-date information from vetted sources. 
Intelligent Screening AI/ML
Traditional approach includes rules engines and a lot of manual work that generates inconsistencies for the overall process and other limitations. 
We move from Rules Engines to ML models that learn from patterns, improve with feedback loops thus improving accuracy rates as well as ensure consistency in the process that is crucial for passing the audit from regulators. 
 
In a nutshell: ARIIA is the innovative, adding-value solution for KYC screening, transaction monitoring, AML compliance and risks identification in a single, intuitive platform. ARIIA are currently looking for funding opportunities to develop the MLP to the next level.

Sourcing talent faces three major problems, which we will solve:

Problem #1:
Every company we worked for had difficulty finding the right software developers. With the plethora of technical skills (1,000+) on the market and uncertainty in seniority, finding the missing piece to achieving the dream team was quite cumbersome.

Problem #2:
The time to source candidates for one role is between 13 and 20 hours a week. In other words, one-third to a half of a week's work. This leads to inefficiency, high costs, and worst of all incredibly-high burnout rates in the recruiting industry.

Problem #3:
The internal cost-per-hire is roughly around $4,700, and outsourced costs can reach sums as high as $50,000. Again, per hire. Let that sink in...


How do we do it: 
By giving talent acquisition professionals a powerful talent search engine, they are able to perform smarter, cheaper, and faster than ever before. Instead of being powered by LinkedIn or Google, Sourcemoon is powered by data found on GitHub—the most popular platform among software developers. We use GitHub API, scraping, and parsing algorithms to collect and make sense of data from GitHub (other platforms coming in the future).

MCon Services,Denmark,mconservice.com,2017,1-10,"IT & Software, Service",B2B,Bootstrapping,"The only thing more important than your time is what you spend it on!

Our mission is to allow small and medium-sized business owners to save time and focus on what is truly important: growing their business. Instead of spending their time on day-to-day administration and management work. We do this through digital transformation and process automation. 

A lot of businesses have amazing potential that is not being utilized because day-to-day operations are taking up most of the time that otherwise could’ve been invested in developing new business ideas and income opportunities. In a large part, the reason for this rising potential is the technological advancement we have seen over the past few years. Although it is creating opportunities, a lot of companies have a hard time adapting their operational and administrative processes to this new way of doing business.   

As mentioned our whole reason for existence is to help companies go through digital transformation, to set themselves free of their old inefficient processes. We use a combination of different frameworks from the fields of Business Process Management and Software Development to tailor digital processes 100% to our client´s workflows, management and operations. 

The nature of our work can described as two integrated phases that each brings a unique value to our client. The first phase is all about in-depth analysis of current processes, painpoints, operation dynamics and redesign of these from a digital perspective adding the technological aspects. The second phase is related to developing the actual automation software, scripts, integrations and business logic using the technologies. There is a catch though: in the second phase, the first phase is actually repeated – the closer we work with the technical development the more opportunities arise along the way, which usually allows us to optimize the processes even more than expected.


How and why did it start?

“The only thing more important than your time is what you spend it on.”

I realized this when I was 16, working a boring data entry job. At that time, I had already moved out and really had to learn how to prioritize my time. My main goal and dream was to become a professional basketball player and this repetitive, boring job was just taking away my valuable time, which I could otherwise be spending at the gym. For the first time in my life, I had too many goals but too little time. So I decided to change that.

What started as a few formulas and scripts to automate my data entry, quickly turned into an app, which turned into 5 apps, and by the time I was 18 turned into my own company.

I realized how small and medium-sized business owners face the same issue I was facing – too many goals, but too little time. And the solution: process automation and digital transformation.

2 years later and counting, I am running a company of process specialists, analysts, consultants, developers, and technical writers to help companies and business owners create more time for what is truly important.

The journey has been awesome, but to be honest it is not all about the success. Just like I see companies as a bunch of processes, I also see life as a process – a learning process! 

Most importantly, this journey has brought me amazing knowledge and experience, which I would never give up for anything, and it shaped into the fearless person I am today. For me, life is about challenging yourself and learning from it – throw yourself into the deep end yet learn to survive!

I will say it one more time: ""The only thing more important than your time is what you spend it on!""

We collaborate with various consultants across different disciplines to provide companies and projects with the needed guidance in developing creative solutions that support the green transition and that contribute to companies' achieving the goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.

Our competencies include, but are not limited to green-fintech, bio-resource management including advice on climate strategies and action plans, biomass sourcing, characterization, pre-treatment, process design development for biorefinery and bioconversion, and digitalization of nature-based solutions, Defi application on real-world assets and product authentication with blockchain technology.

Together with partners, we are turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities. We are building innovative solutions and technology dedicated to sustainability for individuals, companies, and consumers' brands while making the green transition just and inclusive for all. 

Currently, we are working on a project with a mission to help local communities in developing countries get direct financial incentives for conserving nature and forest restoration activities. Part of the project's mission is to eradicate the corporate ""Greenwashing"" and ""Double-counting"" problems in the voluntary carbon credit markets. At present, the ACRYPT-supported project has more than 20,000+ followers and received more than 19,000+ commitments to the project worldwide, and still growing every day. 

Approx. 3.4 billion tons of CO2 are released into the atmosphere every day worldwide. However, we can do a lot to reduce our emissions, it is possible to stay completely CO2 neutral by offsetting our carbon footprint through restoration and forest conservation activities. Our solution helps businesses’ CSR initiatives are traceable, transparent, and verifiable—thus avoiding greenwashing. 

In some countries, indigenous groups formed cooperatives so they could certify a nature-based project for voluntary emission reduction. Through this system, industries and individuals voluntarily compensate for their emissions or provide an additional contribution to mitigating climate change. However, this is a non-regulated system and therefore the problem of double-counting can exist. In other words, emission reduction is claimed twice, which is detrimental to the entire climate benefit of all the Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, under the Paris Agreement. Nevertheless, ACRYPT's transparent solution will help industries and companies avoid double-counting errors while also ensuring that the actual CO2 absorbed by the tree is properly accounted for. 

CO2 offset is a global need, hence providing a disruptive solution and sustainable technology is so timely. The CO2 offset market is expected to reach USD 235.2 million by the end of 2026. With the right technology and marketing in place, we can reach a global audience where millions of individuals can use our technology while saving the environment. 

Every Tree Counts!

We spent years in the financial industry and in the startup ecosystem of Europe. Through the years we have seen startups fail and succeed — and one determining factor of their fate has been repeatedly their access to capital.

A good idea, a good team or the right timing are important determinant of the success rate, but if there is no fuel in the form of capital and cash flow, no matter how great the idea, the company will fail.

Startups and companies often turn to angel investors, venture funds or accelerators to supply growth, however for this they would have to give up large chunks of ownership of their companies, chunks that could be worth a lot more with time.

On the other hand, investors wouldn’t provide capital unless there is market validation in the form of paying customers.  

Applying for loans at commercial banks is tough. The application process takes months and approval rates are low. Personal guarantees, collaterals, securities, and additional fees apply.  

All these forms of financing don’t support the growth trajectory of an early business — they come with too many terms and conditions, restrictions and legal mumbo-jumbo.

Our solution: Kvikk. With our network of investors, we raised a small fund that enables us to discover and fund promising early businesses — and work with them on the long term.

Nicoline Hansen,Denmark,nicolinehansen.com,2014,1-10,Fashion & Living,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Nicoline Hansen is searching for a partner with strong marketing and PR skills.

It is Nicoline Hansen's mission to develop showpiece designs in sustainable latex for fashion connoisseurs. The Danish brand offers luxurious designs that make the customer stand out, thus making it easy to create a strong visual style. 

Latex has not yet reached its full potential as a high-fashion material and plant-based alternative to leather, although in recent years it has been used extensively by celebrities and has given an edge to luxury designs on the catwalk (Read here from Vogue https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/gallery/latex-aw20).

Latex is strong and biodegradable just like leather, but vegan and far less harmful to the environment. It is tapped from rubber trees in Malaysia where working conditions and the environment are in order. Depending on the thickness and color, it looks and feels like silk or soft lambskin. It is comfortable to wear because it stretches and keeps its shape perfectly while adapting to the body's movements. Nicoline Hansen designs are unique because we create elegant and comfortable designs by combining them with other luxurious and biodegradable fabrics.

The target group is the fashion connoisseur with a strong, innovative style. The customer finds joy in being creative when dressing and attracting the eyes of others. She/he lives an urban life and is enthusiastic about quality and sustainability when investing in garments.
Customers are reached via Instagram and the webshop. I have a few selected retailers and expect to get more when production is in place.

Challenges
For several years I have worked with especially custom designs in latex, and been responsible for everything myself - development, design, marketing, pricing, production, etc. It has given me many skills, but also spread me thin over many tasks. I am currently looking for a manufacturer of my designs, and have contacted a company in Italy that has worked with latex for other luxury brands. I want to delegate as much as possible and focus on what I do best. My abilities lie in the product - elegant designs with an edge and great material know-how.

Needs
I am looking for a partner who compliments my abilities - who I can spar with and who can dedicate him/herself to sales and PR in luxury fashion. A partner who either has time to do the legwork or has the opportunity to invest and delegate to other specialists.


With a unique brand and a strong collaboration, the potential is great and it is my ambition that we should be a well-known luxury brand. Hermes is known for leathergoods and silk, Louis Vuitton for bags. Nicoline Hansen will be known for creating luxury clothing in latex.

Copenhagen has in the past three years been elected the most expensive city in the world to buy coffee, with a stunning price of around 42 DKK per cup. While most of the bigger coffee chains strive under these conditions and extend their market share, many local cafés and restaurants suffer. This is due to high competition, and low customer loyalty, where the big chains win on their great locations, and huge marketing budgets.

Rista is a benfrit to be apart off, if you buy more than 3 cups of coffee a month. We believe that with we can change the coffee industry, and give a helping hand to the local restorations.

We make crowd investment campaigns easy and affordable to launch and manage with our ""shopify for crowdfunding"" Software-as-a-Service. Our white-label solution is a one-stop-shop with everything you need to launch and manage a successful crowd investment campaign (or platform) - directly from your own website. 

We want to unlock private wealth together, by making crowd investment accessible and easy to use for everyone, so company (and platform) owners can focus on generating revenue, securing jobs, paying more taxes and hopefully even get more time with their family.
We assist companies in their efforts of creating growth, by making it easy, affordable and without legal struggles to raise funds directly from the company’s own website and help reach out to thousands of potential investors. Raise funding through equity or lending and turn your happy customers into loyal investors.

Fundraising can be extremely time-consuming, slow and exhausting. Building a funnel, setting up meetings, presenting and performing (even more stressful if you are an introverted founder like we are), dealing with many different demands, being an ""underdog"" and seeing the valuation drop after each meeting.... and you're still not able to get in touch with the right private investors.
We have been there and it was not a nice place to be. So we decided to turn something that's really exhausting, confusing and time-consuming into something that gives you confidence and free time to focus on building your business.

Byggbranschen dras nämligen med stora utmaningar. Visste du att kostnaderna för bristande kvalitet i svenska byggprojekt uppgår till ca 100 miljarder SEK varje år? De pengarna skulle räcka till att producera ca 50 000 lägenheter i allmännyttan. Detta är inte hållbart! 

Därför har vi tillsammans med branschorganisationen Byggherrarna och Luleå tekniska universitet, utvecklat PQi - världens första automatiserade molntjänst för kvalitetsmätning av byggprojekt. Målet är att etablera en ny internationell branschstandard för att mäta byggprojekt.

Med hjälp av PQi kan projektintensiva organisationer kvalitetsmäta hela sin projektportfölj. Kunden kan jämföra sin projektkvalitet med Best Practice för branschen, studera trender och identifiera förbättringsormåden. På så sätt kan kunden fånga upp avvikelser innan de utvecklas till stora problem och kostnader.

1. Personal digital meetings. 
There is a need for e-retailers to bring personal shopping experience online. Today, there is no good support for personal digital meetings (one-to-one) where sellers can showcase products live and help the customer to buy, for example by adding products to the shopping cart.

2. Modern communication. There is a need to improve the customer experience with modern communication such as chat, video and live streaming. Today's consumers are used to modern communication such as WhatsApp, FaceTime, Youtube, TikTok.

3. Omnichannel communication. 
There is a lack of sales coordination between physical stores and e-commerce (omnichannel) which puts the buyer at the center and uses the selling company's resources efficiently.

We are creating a digital platform for managing innovation hubs by automating insight gathering, resource allocation and overview.

Problem
​Innovation is a key economic value driver in our world today and it happens when an interaction between people from different backgrounds come together to solve problems. Innovation ecosystems (Incubators, accelerators, clusters, and R&D departments) are created to manage this interaction and turn it into success. The larger the innovation ecosystem, the bigger the task. Managers spend more time trying to have an overview over the ecosystem. More time is used on expanding it, tracking progress, problems and resources than actually facilitating the interaction that drives innovation. The ecosystems also act as gatekeepers of information and face challenges managing these resources as they grow larger.

How
By buidling a system that provides overview to not only managers but also all the actors in a innovation ecosystem. The system tracks progress and activity on project profiles and resource use. That is then provided in a user-friendly dashboard as actionable data. This reduces the costs and time spent administering the ecosystem and increases managers’ time to build successful startups.

Why
EnableMagic grew out of the need to solve problems. We saw that 90% of startups fail even with help from incubators and many good ideas are wasted because of reaccuring problems. Problem that could been mitigatet with the right tools.

The current value chain is fragmented and driven by middlemen leading to a multitude of problems such as High cost/trade cycle/counterfeit/capital blockage and Low trust/trade discovery/provenance.

50-60% of the trade volume is driven by SMEs, this problem could be solved only by enabling digital inclusion to their trade. Hence we built Ethically+, an integrated Marketplace with secure payment, logistics, testing labs/validation peers etc. powered by a distributer ledger, providing digital inclusion (trade discovery & settlement
) to micro, small and medium sized enterprises in the jewelry value chain.

Some of the features we are bringing into the platform are:
1. Services such as logistics, certification etc. are integrated and could be availed from within the platform.
2. A digital Escrow service is in place for secure transfer of funds between the users, initially capped at $100K per transaction. Escrow could potentially reduce frauds. 
3. Digital underwriting and credit for payment could be availed by eligible buyers via our platform.
4. A distributed ledger maintains the autonomy of data.
5. Encryption of major supply chain events (asset creation, trade confirmation, payment confirmation, shipping, processing) pertaining to each listing into this ledger to create provenance.
6. No subscription fees unlike RapNet and transactional commissions only (5-10%), charged to Buyers.

The last 25 years an investment in the real estate market has shown great returns. However, the barriers for a private investor to invest directly exposed to the real estate market are big, with demands of great capital. This means that the ones with limited capital doesn't have a way of investing.

By buying and holding these shares, our customers can take part of the value increase of the property as well as continuous payouts from rental gains of the tenant, and then make an exit whenever they want through the share market integrated in the platform. 

Apartly came to life through the vision to ensure financial democracy in acknowledged investment classes that today doesn't have one. Our aim right now is to start with the real estate market.

The way we work matters, and it has never been more important to focus on that to keep us relevant and competitive – that’s why we put our money on people, purpose, collaboration, belonging, and leadership.

At Trackunit, we’re committed to construction - one of the largest industries in the world. 

It’s an industry of strong, hard-working people, building the infrastructure of our lives. An industry that used to be known for the cities it built and the landscapes it formed. For complex infrastructures and the rise of skyscrapers in unthinkable shapes and sizes.

Construction enables each one of us to live better lives through safer roads and rails, modern hospitals and schools, offices and homes. But for too long, the industry has been known for blown-up budgets and schedules delayed by months. 

At Trackunit, we believe we can still do the impossible and rebuild the reputation of the industry. 

New technology has emerged, and today we know more than ever before. We build the services that enable construction to work smarter together and grow faster together.

nabogo,Denmark,nabogo.com,2018,1-10,"Energy & Greentech, Maritime & Transport, Sales & Marketing",B2B,Series A,"Peer-to-peer ridesharing is the answer to many challenges. For example, on average only 1.05 people are seated in a commuter car, resulting in peak demands, queues and time wasted in the traffic. Furthermore, finding parking spaces in towns and cities and near large workplaces has not become easier. And last but not least, the high level of single-occupancy in vehicles has a significant impact on the environment.

With a dedicated ridesharing effort, it is not unrealistic that together we can reduce the number of cars and CO2 emissions by up to 25%. That is why we have created
nabogo, a ridesharing service for commuting and driving daily trips from villages to towns, business areas and stations. Our primary customer is the municipalities, and once the solution is established in the area, it can be used at no cost to the users.

A successful transition to ridesharing does, of course, require the active support of municipalities, educational institutions, businesses and local communities in spreading information about the possibility of greener and cheaper commuting. And here, we are fortunately well on the way with several cross-cutting collaborations.

A core functionality of the nabogo app is our pre-defined meeting places at locations to and from which people drive and that act as fixed collection and set-down locations for ridesharing. This makes it easy and quick to coordinate ridesharing, while creating a new infrastructure and improved mobility in the area.

The app is deeply integrated with public transport in order to show all possibilities. We establish meeting places in cooperation with our partners, and the function means that there are good interchange points between ridesharing and public transport, for example at the stations. Nabogo is thus a complete alternative to driving in your own car.

In cooperation with the municipalities, the communications effort is targeted towards villages and towns, and we engage companies and educational institutions so that the citizens are informed where they live and work or study.

Upon receipt of the goods the end-user fold the RE-ZIP packaging to a returns format and deliver it at a mail box or a parcel store and the packaging is returned to RE-ZIP warehouse for cleaning and re-circulation to our customers. The RE-ZIP packaging can be circulated more than 20 times.

Simplewire,Denmark,simplewire.io,2020,1-10,Science & Engineering,B2B,Seed,"Simplewire is a young but fast growing hardware startup, trying to solve a problem as old as electricity itself.  As you might know, all buildings contain a myriad of electrical installations, which must be marked according to their point of origin. The process is called marking. Today, it is done manually with thousands and thousands of labels on wires, sockets, lamp sockets and junction boxes. Marking costs an enormous amount of labor time in planning and execution, and is virtually impossible to do correctly, as human error is inevitable. That leads to poor marking, which is a huge concern for building owners.

Simplewire is a digital system that's installed at the switchboard. ASK modulated signals are transmitted on the wires, and can be picked up wirelessly by our reader device. Doing it the old way, with labels, would have taken months and months to complete, and even longer in old buildings, if at all possible. With Simplewire, a whole building's electrical installation can be mapped 100% correctly, in less than an hour, and with no needed maintenance.

We have 3 devices. A Controller for each switchboard, which controls an amount of Routers (one for each breaker), and a Reader, which the building's managers and electricians have, that's used to read the wireless signals from the wires.
We use an MCU to modulate a bitstream which contains the ID of each Router, which is transmitted on the wire. An analog front-end demodulates the signal into a bitstream, which is resampled with a MCU, so the ID can be unpacked and presented to the user.

There's not much to it - we build hardware, nothing else. We design the analog electronics ourselves, in our electronics lab, before having them built by our PCB fabrication. We write all the code for our MCUs and we build and test and build and test and build and test until it works.

Trebo,Denmark,trebo.dk,2018,1-10,"Energy & Greentech, Science & Engineering",B2B,Pre-seed,"Trebo is a cleantech startup that develops and manufactures a novel fluid-mechanical based plastic sorting technology. The sorting technology enables the plastic industry to sort large-scale plastic-type mixtures and transform the industry’s production waste into valuable resources. 

The Procurement costs on virgin materials are reduced and the environmental impact from incinerating or dumping plastic waste is eliminated.

The annual global production of plastic has in 2019 exceeded more than 300,000,000,000 kg and even though the majority of plastic waste is suited for recycling purposes, more than 90% of the global production of plastic is either incinerated, deposited or dumped in nature. As the production of one kilogram of virgin plastic on average requires three kilograms of natural oil, the plastic industry is a global large-scale consumer of fossil fuels and therefore an important intrant in the green and sustainable changeover of the industry.   

Due to the wide palette of applications and physical characteristics of plastics, many end-user plastic products consist of one or more different types of plastic. As the quality and application performance of mixed plastic is decreased critically compared to the pure counterpart, plastic mixes are often considered as waste and therefore incinerated or sold to a price significantly lower than the price of the virgin plastic. 

Industrial waste streams of mixed plastic constitute approximately 60% of the total plastic waste stream. We believe it is critical to develop  technologies that effectively sorts and restores the value and physical properties of the virgin plastic. 

At Trebo, we are environmentalists and our vision is to make the global plastic industry more sustainable and renewable. We hope that you will join us on our adventure.

ChronosHub enables authors to select suitable journals for their manuscript submissions by making funding policies and institutional agreements transparent. Through a collaborative approach, ChronosHub streamlines the workflow for institutions, publishers and funders for an effective APC management, OA agreement monitoring, funding policy compliance, repository deposits and OA reporting.

Our History
In 2014, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced its Open Access Policy to accelerate the impact of its funded research. ChronosHub was built in 2016 to encourage adoption of the policy, reduce complexity, and minimize manual work. While initially built for the Gates Foundation, ChronosHub was re-designed to scale to the broader research community to simplify implementation of publishing policies for research and address the grantees’ concerns about additional workload. ChronosHub takes a collaborative approach to support all scholarly communication stakeholders throughout the publishing process. Since the launch in 2017, ChronosHub is managing over 20 thousand grants and ten thousand OA articles with over $22 million in article processing charges (APCs). 

What we contribute to
Research is fundamental to humanity, but the world of academic publishing is getting more and more complex. Researchers spend up to 35% of their time on administration, funders struggle with compliance management, institutions lack transparency, and publishers are challenged by new business models.  The market for research publication is currently being transformed by an increase in Open Access and Open Science, and there are more than eight million researchers eligible for the trillion of dollars granted to research every year, so the potential impact is huge. More than three million journal articles were published in 2019 – that’s 8,000 per day, and $750 million paid in Article Processing Charges (APCs). A number that’s expected to double in the coming years.

MULGEO copenhagen,Denmark,mulgeo.dk,2018,1-10,Fashion & Living,Marketplace,Seed,"We are MULGEO copenhagen - Danish design brand making sustainable multifunctional furnitures and living solutions.  Our main product is the square fibre stool with rounded corners made of 100% mono-materiel Kraftliner.  In addition, the material Kraftliner is made of replanted trees, which makes the production of the stool CO2-neutral.

The environment is our priority and one of our number one values is sustainability and green design. That’s why we produce sustainable and long-lasting products that are useful and multifunctional. Circularity is crucial in our brand philosophy, therefore we follow our product journey from manufacturing to recycling into new materials. 

We believe in the power of smart products and sustainable, quality materials. Moreover, our goal is to encourage people to integrate these innovative products in their homes and with that, create a close–to–nature ambiance; wherever they live.

MULGEO box-chair is made of a multilayer, glued cardboard called Kraftliner. Kraftliner is a ‘virgin’ and pure paper which - made with the highest technologies – allows the material to bear up to 350 kilograms. This is one of the most durable and sturdy paper types out there and worth to mention: it is fully recyclable.

This material is FSC-approved, and it ensures that our suppliers are responsible for the trees circularly replanted in Sweden. There is a myth that paper made from recycled fibre is a more responsible choice than paper made from fresh fibre. The fact is, that without fresh wood from sustainably managed forests, the world would eventually run out of paper. Why? Because after several uses, recycled fibers get too short and worn out and have to be replaced with fresh ones. The good news is that the fresh fibre we use is truly sustainable. 

The production of MULGEO furniture is a process without any CO2-emissions and the only waste materials that occur are pieces of die-cuts, which are recycled after production. Handles for example are recycled in creating new designs.

Our whole supply chain is based in Europe - we design in Denmark, source in Sweden and produce in Europe.

Our concept is a light weighted fire retardant board that is also intended to improve internal ventilation. 
Rumett's vision is to give the market a more sustainable option for dry walls, as our product is more environmentally conscious and made of recyclable materials. By choosing our Ash board, we want our customers to know they're helping reduce landfill costs, pollution, and waste.

Our product is going through various test parameters that live up to DS standards; we are, for example, looking into the strength ( Tensile and compression) and uniformity of the product.

Our Ash used in the element is outsourced in Denmark from cafes that use coal briquettes made out of coconut husk; the coal is clean and has no toxic materials. Moreover, we have also received a sample from a facility in Denmark called "" Halo Sep,"" which is a process that cleans Ash coming from the burning facility "" Vestforbrænding"" in Glostrup. Vestforbrændingen produces around 15 tons of Ash every year. The estimated ash waste is 200-300 kg from the Cafees we have outsourced.

We are soon also planning to implement a demonstration proof of concept project with a social impact. The project location is in Lebanon, where refugees living in informal settlements are prone to increased fire outbreaks because their tented structure is made out of wood and plastic only due to authorities' regulations prohibiting them from using concrete in their tent.

The demonstration project is a pilot project where we would measure the impact of the ash board by designing various scalable parameters such as technical, social, and data measures. The project outcome will be reported, and upon results, a methodology will be set to optimize the product further. The project will work in parallel to implementing the element in the Danish market, where we have multiple stakeholders collaborating with us.

Various professional coaches currently support us on the project, such as "" KØBENHAVNS KOMMUNE -Teknik- on Miljøforvaltningen, ""where we won after pitching our idea for a customized mentor program to optimize and induce progress. Moreover, we have also been lucky to have won support from "" Bolig Kuben.""

Our team consists of three people; a Mechanical engineer specializing in materials, a construction architect, and a designer.

Because we believe that the decision to invest in a bike should be valued and met with a product that will last for many years. 

Recapture is just one example of the digital challenges our company face. There’s plenty more, which is why we need people with all sorts of technical skills.

Molnix Oy,Finland,molnix.com,2014,1-10,"Healthcare & Life Science, IT & Software, SaaS, Service","B2B, B2G",Bootstrapping,"Molnix is a fast-growing startup that aims to improve the humanitarian work globally with our Rapid Personnel Manager (RPM). RPM is a cloud based HR Master software that enables fast deployments, cost efficient operations and higher impact of humanitarian workers. In the future, we will also offer RPM to other sectors.

The origins of Molnix and Rapid Personnel ManagerBy Johan Ehnberg, Founder and CEO of MolnixWhile working in the humanitarian field for five years, I witnessed a critical need for a software that supports rapid deployments. We needed a solution to manage and mobilize staff to be deployed into disaster areas, in situations where time is of essence. However, there were no tools available to us.I set out to see how others were solving the issue, to see if there are any viable solutions in the market. But what I found was a lot of excel files which were not very efficient. There were also some the heavy weight solutions built upon the larger ERPs or CRMs. Some were in the same situation as the organization I was with at the time, using in-house software that was hard to maintain. I even found one organization that was using an educational system, on top of which they had built a solution to manage their roster. Up until now, the situation has not changed. The closest match to direct competition are ERPs’ HR modules with heavy customization from ready (COTS) products, or purely custom application development and management (CADM).Molnix was born to fill this gap, spearheaded by the product Rapid Personnel Manager. It is a cloud-based HR app that is now in production in the humanitarian field – the Finnish Red Cross being our public reference customer. The goal now is to bring Rapid Personnel Manager to as many customers as possible. We will start by targeting humanitarian agencies. The app’s logic applies well to many other sectors to follow; manpower agencies, security services, freelance guilds and more can benefit from our service.With this app, our customers’ HR activities become considerably faster and more cost efficient. Especially in the field of disaster management, speed translates to higher impact (such as lives saved or aid delivered). Cost savings in turn stem from automation of many HR tasks such as alerting, reporting, data quality monitoring and use of public API:s. Cost savings are also a function of offloading work from the registry owner through enabling end users to perform many of the tasks themselves.Molnix as a businessBeyond the Rapid Personnel Manager, Molnix Oy is a startup based in Espoo, Finland. Our specialty is in combining humanitarian aid, information technology and human resource management. We are driven by social impact and fueled by making commercially sustainable products.To deliver this, we provide an infrastructure tailored for ultimate disaster resilience that supports our customers’ operations as well as our own. This, combined with our support services, allows us to provide an end-to-end IT solution for very demanding environments.

Soletair Power,Finland,soletairpower.fi,2016,11-50,"Energy & Greentech, Science & Engineering",B2B,Seed,"Utilizing building ventilation systems to capture atmospheric CO2 and generate three-way benefits - reducing emissions, environmental benefits, and reducing CO2 exposure for the residents.
Over half of the world’s population is currently urban, with predictions that this number will likely grow by 1.56 billion over the next two decades. As a result, we will see new megalopolises emerge, and an exponential increase in the construction of new buildings and CO2 emissions. This surge in the number of people living and working in buildings will only reinforce the challenge of guaranteeing the best air quality levels possible. A high concentration of CO2 has been proven to make people feel dizzy, tired, and sleepy. A Harvard study shows that for each 400-ppm increase in indoor CO2 concentration, our cognitive function score becomes 20% lower. Ours is the most affordable technology for increasing overall employee wellbeing by preventing their productivity from decreasing by 20%.
If buildings can be used as CO2 capturing machines the lifetime emission can be offset. One single system for building ventilation of 3m3/s can capture 20 tons of CO2 per year. In a single building, one might have, for example, 20 ventilation units. So, per building, it is 400 tons of CO2 captured per year. When the system is used with renewable electricity (5kWh energy required per kilo CO2 captured) (20g/kWh) the emission is 100g when 1000g is captured. By transforming buildings into carbon sinks, net-zero targets can become achievable. Buildings become an active protector of environments and contribute to global negative CO2 emissions.
Soletair Power captures carbon utilizing buildings' ventilation systems, which achieves up to a 50% reduction in emissions, supports employee wellbeing, and increases productivity. Soletair Power’s modular solution operates with a plug-and-play approach, enabling any company to install and use Direct Air Capture. The captured carbon can be reused as a non-fossil-based resource in a wide array of applications, effectively rewinding the impact of CO2.

Vår misjon er å tilby lokale og personlige båtopplevelser som gjør det mer attraktivt å dele nullutslipps elbåter enn å eie eller leie et fossilt alternativ. Vårt 10-års mål er å gjøre deling av nullutslippsbåt til den nye normen for vår målgruppe innen 2030.

Målgruppen vår bruker båt mellom 3-15 turer i året, og har et båtliv som gjør at de kan dele båt. Båtliv undersøkelsen er soleklar og sier at 52% av båten i Norge brukes i snitt 7,5 turer, 75% brukes i sitt 14,5 turer og 17% settes bare ut og brukes aldri.

Kruser er det første båtpoolen i verden som utelukkende driver med båtdeling av kun nullutslipps - elbåter med elektrisk fremdrift. Vi skal være en pådriver for det miljøvennlige båtlivet, og vise verden at et båtliv som er miljøvennlig og spiller på lag med omgivelsene fungerer.

Data fra vår pilot sessong (2020) sier at om 20% av dagens tilgjengelige båter hadde blir omdisponert til utslippsfrie dele båter ville over 250.000 flere familier kommet seg på fjorden, vil vi sammen redusert utslipp av Co2 med 100.000 tonn i året, og redusert utslipp av mikroplast tilsvarende 1,2 millioner plastposer.

I Kruser får du jobbe i et ungt selskap som er opptatt av bærekraft, innovasjon, teknologi og - ikke minst- fantastiske kundeopplevelser. Du vil delta i front av det som skjer innen miljøvennlig fritidsbåt i verden. Vi er visjonære og alltid opptatt av å endre oss til det bedre.

Zeabuz,Norway,zeabuz.com,2019,11-50,"Energy & Greentech, Maritime & Transport, Robotics",B2C,Series A,"Zeabuz is a spin-off from the leading research community on autonomous vessels at NTNU in Trondheim. Our autonomy technology is field-proven for shortcuts across urban waterways, and we are now searching for long-term investors while preparing for market launch.

Water used to be the main infrastructure for most cities in the world. While roads are filling up everywhere, much of the urban waters are have become highly underutilized. At Zeabuz we want to reverse this trend by introducing a technology platform that makes local waterborne transport an economically viable and sustainable option. Our mobility system, which comprises a combination of a network of small vessels, electric drive, and autonomous operation, is a truly scalable solution fit for many of the world’s urban areas. 

Enabling increased flow by utilizing available waterways will allow more people to travel by foot and bike and hence will reduce the need for road traffic and in the end reduce emissions of climate gasses. Another perspective is that dynamic utilization of waterways will reduce the need for new inflexible infrastructures such as roads and bridges, which saves both money, emissions from concrete production, and local footprint.

The Zeabuz urban mobility system will be a compelling and attractive mobility solution for cities globally.

Rough estimates have shown that there is a market for approx. 4000 Zeabuz-like ferries in the EU alone. Zeabuz aims to take a major share of this emerging market.

The company is founded on the idea that passenger transport across urban waters is a highly suitable starting point for commercializing autonomous mobility. In this segment, risks are mitigated by low speeds and high physical margins which also allow us to focus on solving only a few problems at a time while still earning positive returns from the start.

As the Zeabuz technology platform matures in this first segment, we will explore its scaling potential across several dimensions. This means we could branch out and adapt to new opportunities and market demand based on our solid foundation in autonomy, assurance, and mobility solutions. Our autonomy platform can be utilized to deliver Autonomy-as-a-Service which enables entries into new markets, new use cases, and an expansion to more complex operational domains. 

Zeabuz is now preparing for launching a commercial pilot in a Scandinavian city in 2022.

Fikse AS,Norway,fiksekurv.no,2021,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS, Fashion & Living","B2C, Marketplace",Seed,"Fixing and repairing of consumer goods are declining, and have been for many years. It can seem cheaper and more convenient to buy a new product and throw away the broken one. At the same time, repair shops need more customers.

We will create a digital booking system to make repairing easier and convenient. Consumers can choose their preferred repair shop and order repairs directly from their couch and have it sent and delivered. At the same time, we help repairers reach new customers online and a CRM system optimised and co-created with repairers.

Our mission is to build a culture for repair and inspire people to take care of what they already have. Our main SDG is number 12 - Responsible consumption and production. Increased volume of repair will lead to lower consumption and inspire consumers to buy less and better products. This is a big goal for Fikse and with our digital system, we know that it will lead to more reuse. In addition, Fikse is also contributing to goals 8, 11, 13 and 17. We care about the environment and will always work for these goals.

In other words: We make repairs easy and convenient.


Problem

Today, repair and maintenance of consumer goods are a real hassle. It can seem cheaper and more convenient to buy a new product and throw away the broken one. In addition, repair shops need more customers and better margins. They also lack a customized system for managing orders and communicating with customers. Retail businesses have a hard time creating a solution for handling warranty and refund.

Research shows that the inconvenience of repair is just as high an obstacle as the price. On the other side, repairers struggle to get customers. They do not have the time, money or resources to be active on social media or promote on digital platforms. They are also lacking a good system for managing orders and communicating with customers.

Solution

We help repair businesses and retail owners reach out to customers and respond to the emerging market for repairs and circularity.
We are in the process of creating a digital booking system to make repairing easy, fast and convenient for all segments above. And we know that this sustainable concept is a service they actually want. At Høyer Paleet in Oslo, you can see for yourself. Together with the high-end retailer, we launched our MVP here in mid may. And what a response. We have over 800 bookings as of september 20, as well as the retail itself. This winter, we will start developing a fully digital version. This way, you can choose your preferred repair shop and order repairs directly from your couch and have it sent and delivered. At the same time, we help repairers reach new customers online by creating a CRM system optimized and co-created with repairers. We can manage all cases of repairs connected to warranty and refund for businesses to ensure the consumer a sustainable practice on all levels.

Our dedicated team is ready to help you take care of what you have - so that your stuff can live longer and you can continue living your life.

Vesiro,Sweden,vesiro.com,2022,1-10,IT & Software,B2B,Pre-seed,"Vesiro is developing a new database software to help retail companies reduce time and energy waste in their data analysis activities using our patented algorithms.

The world is becoming increasingly reliant on data. Facebook alone generates 4 PB every day, and a single person generates 1.7 MB every second. The pandemic shifted our behaviour further online and accelerated the digitalization of society and technologies on the rise such as 5G, AI and IoT will accelerate this shift even further. All of these trends means that there is an increasing need to analyze data, which means that new technologies enabling databases with higher performance are needed. 

Retail companies collect increasing amounts of data due to the fact that their customers are shopping online more than ever before. Data Analysts at these companies can waste hours everyday waiting for data to load from the databases into their Business Analytics tools, which results in unnecessary costs to the company and an inefficient way of working for the analysts. In the future, we can move into other data intensive industries such as automotive and Medtech & pharma.
What’s more, the longer it takes to search for data in a database, the more energy is used by the server where the data is stored. This is important as the world’s data centres consumed close to double the amount of energy than Sweden did in 2020, and in 2030 they are expected to represent 10% of the global energy demand. This means that society’s reliance on digital products and services is having a direct and increasing impact on the climate. With this in mind and the fact that energy prices are soaring globally, it is more important than ever to make these processes more efficient. 

We are developing a new database software based on our patented algorithms that enable much faster search in large databases. The technology is the result of several years of development and has been validated at AI Sweden’s facilities, with tests showing that our algorithms are at least 150% faster than conventional algorithms. Using our technology, our aim is to take a novel approach to saving companies time and money in data intensive applications. A positive effect of our technology is the ability to reduce the energy usage of the servers where the data is stored.

Our long-term vision is to help digitalization become more sustainable through giving our customers better database performance leading to reduced energy use. We think that few people are aware of the energy consumption and emissions from data centers, which is what motivates us to work towards helping solve this problem. At the same time, we think that this problem will grow both in impact and in people’s awareness over the coming decade, which is why we believe the timing is right to do something about it. We also have patented our technology, which means that we are in a unique to do it.

Eningo,Sweden,eningo.se,2019,1-10,"Energy & Greentech, SaaS",B2B,Bootstrapping,"Eningo, is a Swedish based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup that wants to help the construction and utilities industry on their journey towards digitalisation. We are part of the European Space Agency Business Incubator (ESA-BIC) accelerator program since 2019 and are in a very exciting phase of our start-up journey. The team consists of highly motivated individuals coming from diverse backgrounds and professional domains with a global growth mindset. You will have the opportunity to impact our company and culture from an early stage and create a legacy of your own! We have an ambitious product vision and are building a team around that, in which you will have a key role to play from day one.

Our vision is to automate and thereby decentralise the process of locating underground utilities. Today, a request made for information about hidden utility infrastructure on a construction site involves many actors. And can take up to a few days to over a week for information to be given to the requester due to the inefficiencies built into the current process. Our products are developed in-order to streamline and automate this process which reduces the lead times from days to minutes. This also enables full traceability and documentation for each request which in turn facilitates accountability in case of damaged infrastructure. We offer a suite of software products to different actors involved in the process of utility locating. 

Our founders have previously operated a business that provides utility locating services and have experienced the problems we are addressing first hand. This inefficiency also leads to wasted resources both for the requester(ex. Construction company) and the infrastructure owner, energy companies. We believe, by addressing this problem we will do our bit in helping these stakeholders in reducing their carbon footprint and promote efforts towards positive climate goals. 

Given their background in building software solutions, they knew there was a better way to do this. Getting customer feedback on this idea helped us validate the business potential even before we registered our company officially back in 2019. Our approach is to create an augmented reality based solution that can deliver information about underground utilities in a matter of seconds, instead of the days of lead times that is common today. This will not only protect the cables and pipes from damage but will increase the efficiency in construction sites.

People love athletes, but cannot invest in them. The betting experience is only based on high risk / short term events and there are high entry barriers to stock market investment where too few sports clubs are listed. 

As a solution we have created a financial market ( https://football.players.exchange ) where people trade virtual shares in professional atheletes. 

Each player's shares have an intrinsic value thanks to their scarcity and to the dividends they can pay. “Everything rare has a certain value which only depends on people's perception and demand for it”.
All players are introduced with a limited number of shares, at a set price. Then, only supply and demand will determine the price of shares. Traders decide for how much they want to buy and sell!

VisaPocket,Sweden,visapocket.com,2019,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS, Service, Travel & Tourism","B2C, B2B",Bootstrapping,"EU member states are among the world's leading tourist and migration destinations. The amount of visa application processed each year is an ever-increasing number. While, this is a good thing, there are also some drawbacks. The many incoming applications has increased the cost of making sticker visa and residence permit cards. Lengthy process and Shipping the visas and resident permit cards through courier service delays the visa process and adds a risk of documents being lost or damaged, in such case a re-issuing of visa or re-submitting of documents is needed. Moreover, visa applicants, that lack knowledge and understanding of Visa Process, end up being rejected or opting for consultancy service where sometimes they become victim of frauds.

The last change that was made to visa application process for Europe was in 2010. This means
that there are 10-years’ worth of problems that require a solution to be developed, in order to
address them.

VisaPocket is a proposed solution for the mentioned problem. It will not only help embassies and consulates but also create a seamless experience for the visa applicants.

VisaPocket offers a wide range of service offerings designed to securely manage visa applications and deliver visas, e-visas, and resident permits in digital manner in their pockets through mobile application or web portal. So, embassies will not only be saving the cost of making these documents but also couriering them. These services are streamlined in visa application lifecycle while providing flexibility for customization for each client. VisaPocket ensures Identity assertion, collecting biometric and biographic information about an applicant and ensures it meets the government quality requirements.

It is also ensured that complete and correct information has been provided and additional
information is requested when supplied material is insufficient or incorrect. Using latest
technologies, Applicants can conveniently apply through our platforms and receive visas directly in their pocket through mobile application or web portal. Moreover, our Immigration support professionals will help applicants throughout the whole visa application process and increase the chances of them getting a positive decision in their case. Along with Visas Consultancy, our services also includes Education Consultancy for the students who are willing to study in Europe, Business Consultancy for the entrepreneurs from non-EU countries who are willing to start business in Europe and Consultancy to Employers in Europe who employs non-EU citizens.

Something which has yet to be hammered out but is still on the agenda is the use of Artificial
Intelligence in the processing of visa applications, prediction of decision of the visa to the visa
applicant and genuine/validity of the documents before they are sent to the respective
embassies / consulates.  Location SwedenWebsite visapocket.comFounded 2019Employees 1-10Industries IT & Software, SaaS, Service, Travel & TourismBusiness model B2C, B2BFunding state Bootstrapping",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Ence is a Norwegian marketplace gathering sustainable brands in one place. Together we offer a wide range of everyday products, produced consciously. We work to gather as socially and environmentally sustainable producers as possible in one place, with the aim of making the path to ethical choices shorter for Norwegian consumers. 

The company was founded June 2020 after the founder's own personal experiences with trying to find ethical and sustainable brands to shop from, but feeling like it was such a time-consuming process. People who want to make good, conscious choices when shopping, should not have to spend hours surfing from one web shop to another to find products they need and background check them. 

This pushed the founder to create a marketplace, strictly for ethical and the most environmental friendly brands. 

This would spare the customer of time; by collecting all the products they need in one place, and doing the background checking for them, and knowledge; by introducing them to brands they may not have heard of before, and provide them with information about sustainability that the dishonest brands do not want to provide for them. 

Today, Ence works together with partnering brands to encourage and educate business leaders who take the responsibility of being more sustainable, so that these types of businesses together can evolve and take up a bigger market share together. By connecting these business leaders together, Ence aims to create a hub for sustainable brands to facilitate their growth.

Our purpose is simple: We want to bring happiness to more people in the world, one small act at a time.

I've always loved the idea of paying it forward. To me, it's a simple way of establishing a connection, practicing kindness, and showing people that you care. And as a bonus, it brings me joy and happiness to give to others.

But as an individual, my resources are limited, so I can only give to some. In addition, going through traditional options like charity organizations or crowdfunding campaigns to support someone very quickly became unmanageable. Furthermore, I often found myself feeling so-so during the selection process. It was either unclear how my support would make a difference, or I didn't feel a sense of connection from entering my credit card number into some given website. The lack of joy in giving led me to an idea.

In 2022, I founded hubopp - a marketplace hub where all people worldwide can easily give or get access to opportunities. An ecosystem that enables people to pay it forward again and again.

Diwala,Norway,diwala.io,2018,1-10,"Education, IT & Software, SaaS",-,-,"Diwala is a Norwegian-based company that is focused on building opportunities for youth, addressing the global issue of identity theft and certification fraud. Today, displaced individuals and people in emerging markets are challenged by high costs and slow manual processes to verify the authenticity of their skills, identity and credentials. As a result, these individuals have to deal with tedious and out-dated credentialing processes, and are in some cases forced to repeat years of education. This leads to both loss of productivity and inflated unemployment. 

Imagine that you had to flee your own home because of war.  Like Aıscha Najjar, a Syrian doctor turned refugee immigrated to the United States to pursue her dream of work & a safe home. Yet, due to loss of information, she was forced to repeat medical school in the United States. If she had a verifiable skill identity, she might have had the privilege of practicing medicine without any questions. Aıscha`s story amongst others epitomizes the challenge Diwala is addressing. 

To tackle this challenge, Diwala has created a platform that enables schools and NGOs to issue skill-based identities, backed by blockchain technology. A skill-ID is a digitally verified record of a person’s educational and work history. Diwala is building an ecosystem of trust, by enabling educational institutions and organizations to safely and digitally issue and verify credentials. This will, in turn, save all parties time, money and build a bridge for global work opportunities for untapped talent. 

Complementing the platform, Diwala has built an app that allows students to easily receive, store and share credentials of both soft and hard skills. By utilizing a decentralized identity management tool, Diwala’s application will also give people ownership of their data information. 

Diwala is currently executing pilots regularly, to optimize the features and security of the platform in both Kenya and Uganda. Working with their implementation partner Clarke University in Kampala, Diwala recently issued the first set of skill-identities to both students and administrators.

At Mybanquet.dk, the user have an easy, inviting and a quick overview of the country's best hosts, restaurants, gastronomes and locations that work with high passion, good quality and professional integrity.

Core service.

Mybanquet.dk core service is the facilitation of the correspondence between guests and hosts, which in the end:

- Saves time and money in the host's operation and with their customers.
- Ensures rapid compliance between the guest's and host's needs, opportunities and desires.
- Expands interfaces between supply and demand in Denmark's B2B and B2C
- Increases topline revenue for our host´s
- Decrease the time spent on aligning expectations from the guest

Basis of ideas.

The idea for Mybanquet.dk started with me wanting to increase awareness of the new exciting restaurants, which has opened in Denmark within the last 10 years. Several of these are run by old colleagues or acquaintances, which is the basis for the simultaneous desire to increase their turnover through that disseminate knowledge of their ""company business"" or ""banquet business"" as referred to in the professional language.

This resulted in the concept “Mybanquet.dk”, which conveys our hosts' offers on the company's solutions for Eight people or more.

Personal resources.

Morten Barsø

I have more than 7 years of experience as a manager in the country's best restaurants, and I have therefore had for a long time
company business close in on life. The most notable places are:
- Noma
- 108
- Kiin Kiin
- Restaurant Kommandanten

I have more than 10 years of experience in planning and running events and events such as.
CPH Fashion Week, Distortion and through this I have independently planned and run everything from weddings to street parties.

At Noma I was in charge of their private dining department as Banquet Manager, we could accommodate up to 150 guests. I was in charge of everything in the department with a team of up to thirty. In addition, I have been in charge of restaurant Kommandanten in their Banquet department in Båstad Sweden, where we held weddings and events for up to 450 people every week, in addition to the normal restaurant operation.

I have found a problem / niche in the industry that gives me the opportunity to take advantage of my competencies, and at the same time work with the people I thrive on working with.

I am persistent and have a huge desire and will to achieve success and have throughout my life been involved in several great successes. Including i.a. the band Lukas Graham since the beginning of their career.
Here I was personal advisor, assistant manager / tour manager m.m. for Lukas Forchhammer, and
from here I have gained a great deal of insight into the requirements for starting a business.

With us, internationals don’t have to go through all the paywalls and translation tools to stay informed and feel like locals. They can read short summaries of the top stories of their region and interests in their daily, customisable personal feed within the time of a fika.

2. It is hard for internationals to get informed and included in Sweden. Without a high level of Swedish, it is taxing for them to find and digest the local news and understand the local politics or what new development and changes are taking place in the city. In addition, there is a high subscription cost of local news, with an average of 2500 kr/year, and they have little information accessible about which newspaper to choose.

This problem is shared among around 300,000 foreign-born who do not speak Swedish and around 350,000 who speak Swedish as a second language. There are around 160,000 incoming international students and immigrants in Sweden every year, with a 5.8% growth rate. These are the people we can help include with our product. By helping them, we also contribute to a more inclusive society.

We plan to have three kinds of revenue. One is end-user subscriptions - we are developing three packages ranging from 20 to 150 kr/month based on the features. We plan to provide AI model services for newspapers. A few newspapers have shown interest in using our AI models on their platforms. We will also feature local businesses and events on our platform. 
Currently, we have no operational costs thanks to the AWS credits provided by KTH Innovation, but in the future, our costs will be marketing, cloud computing, salaries, and R&D.

4: The initial spark was during a conversation we friends had about current events in Sweden, where Melker talked about the news he heard about and experienced, however none of the internationals had ever heard about the events. I am from Sweden. And it is such a shame that in this democratic country, famous for all its inclusiveness and effort for equality, if you don’t speak Swedish, you will have a very hard time understanding the local information and integrating in society. I really believe internationals deserve to have the necessary information no matter if the don't speak swedish.

We are building an engine that automatically sells an item for them, and they keep 80% of the price. Read more at maiapp.se. 

TO DO THIS, SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE TACKLE ARE:
- Predict any resale items market valuation
- Publish the item om multiple resale platforms for bigger reach
- Predict on what platforms the item will sell
- Provide a hassle free peer 2 peer shipping experience

WHAT MAKES US BELIEVE IN THIS
After running a beta version of our service for 6 months we see that our users love Mai. With a retention at 50% and a low customer aquisition cost the potential to scale is huge. We have sold 1000+ items with high user retention and happiness, and we have a 3x higher share sold rate and 1.5x higher sold price compared to other siloed resale marketplaces.

And the best of all (what drives us): At scale, Mai could play a significant role in lowering the emissions from the fashion industry. Buying and selling used instead of new is the #1 most effective way to lower the emissions.

THE OFFER
After closing a first round of investments we are now looking to expand our team with 2-3 senior developers. The team will be relatively small and we will have a lot of fun! As an early employee, we'll offer you shares of the company together with good salary. You will work next to our amazing Co-Founder and CTO Daniel Sundman with 20+ years engineering experience from Silicon Valley and Stockholm.

CHALLENGE
Today, decision-makers in the Green Transition are ill-equipped to make data-driven decisions and meet the challenge of reducing GHG emissions by 45% by 2030. They spend a lot of time and resources looking for relevant data, they work with fragmented decision tools, and have an inefficient engagement with complex stakeholders, who sometimes have different or competing values and interests. All these complexity and data challenges are bottlenecks in the Green Transition, and missed business opportunities. 

SOLUTION 
SurPlusMap makes it easy for decision-makers and stakeholders to collaborate and make data-driven decisions on where to develop green sustainable industries. They find all relevant data in SurplusMap and our user interface facilitates collaboration improving the quality and speed of the early planning phases, saving time and money. 

With SurplusMap’s energy companies, utilities, local or national governments, and green industries such as green hydrogen, data centers, battery factories make collaborative and data-driven decisions that accelerate the Green Transition. 

OUR VISION 
Surplusmap combines the power of cloud computing, earth observation technology, big data analytics, ML & AI, with UX design to create the ultimate no-code collaborative geospatial analytics platform designed specifically to meet the data complexity of climate change action and the green transition.

We want to remove data gatekeepers and other bottlenecks, making it easy for everybody involved in the Green Transition to understand relevant data and use it to expedite data-driven decision-making to foster green economic development and achieve the goal of reducing GHG emissions by 45% by 2030.

Djuce,Sweden,djucewines.com,2021,1-10,Food & Beverage,B2B,Seed,"Collaborating with a team of Michelin-starred sommeliers, we hand select stunning wines and neatly deliver them in bold cans. Why? Because the Earth is begging us to shake things up. 

Our goal is to provide great wines while saving the environment. By switching to cans over the glass you are making a decision to join us in making a dramatic difference for the planet. Ditch the antiquated bottle and reach for something unique. Something adorned with art that moves us to think and revel in life.

Aluminium is an incredible wine container. It's 28x more efficient to recycle than bottles and 3/4 of all aluminium ever mined is still in use today! By joining the switch from bottles to cans you’re helping us cut 79% of the CO2 emissions on packaging. If that’s not exciting enough, consider that cans are twenty times lighter, twice as efficient to transport, and don't break as easily.

Vores kunder er både kvalitets- og miljøbevidste. De kan se værdien i at modtage deres bestilling, senest to timer efter den er høstet. Hverken smag eller næringsværdi går tabt under leveringen, som selvfølgelig foregår med cykelbud. Sådan trækker vi i fællesskab fødevareindustrien i en sundere og mere bæredygtig retning. Det er det, vi forstår ved godt naboskab.

Afgrøderne er naturligvis fri for sprøjtegift og genmodifikationer. Deres næringskilder er en nøje udvalgt sammensætning af ilt, mineraler, varme, vand og god musik.

Tilsammen har vi mere end 15 år i tech-branchen på bagen. Den erfaring har vi brugt til at udvikle en software, som kan styre planternes omgivelser ned til mindste detalje.

CabiBUS Sustainable Mobility AB develop an autonomous electric minibus and system for sustainable, on demand, door-to-door, safe, secure, economic and efficient public transportation, parcel delivery and recycling collection. 
The minibus will have a unique patented design with separate cabins for each passenger, offering a comfortable and secure travel for all types of passengers. It solves the problem with fear of sharing rides with strangers or sending children to school or activities in a minibus without a driver. It also solves the problem with risk for viruses and infections in public transportation since each cabin have fresh air supply with selectable temperature and UV-C light disinfection when a cabin is empty. In case of an accident, each passenger is protected in the rigid cabin with airbags and air curtains all around, not possible in vehicles with open interiors. Between the cabins there is a strong framework that makes the vehicle withstand impacts from all sides, also only possible with this solution. 
In evenings and weekend, when people are at home and it is less demand for person transportation, cabins in some of the vehicles are exchanged with parcel box cabins and used for silent and fossil free e-commerce distribution and recycling collection.
Several business models are possible.
- The designs and patents can be licensed to vehicle manufacturers in different parts of the world. 
- Vehicles are manufactured and sold mobility operators.
- Vehicles are manufactured and used by the company as a Robotaxi mobility operator.

Autonomous mobility services are predicted to become the major mode of transportation and CabiBUS  can become a unicorn in this field within 5 years.

Alvira,Sweden,getalvira.com,2017,1-10,"Consumer Goods, IT & Software, IoT","B2C, B2B",Bootstrapping,"Home security is broken. Together we can fix it.

We at Alvira are reinventing what home security is, how it works and who can afford it. Our sensors prevents both fires and break-ins, powered by a hyper-local neighbourhood watch. Together we can fix a flawed industry and allow everyone the safety that they deserve.

---

Today, home security is not something everyone can afford. A contract with the biggest home security company in Sweden, Verisure, starts at a whopping 369 kronor/month, which is more than your Spotify, Netflix and HBO subscriptions, combined. That contract only covers a small apartment, and I haven't even mentioned the upfront cost of over 4 000 kronor just to get started. Unfortunately this is pretty much the same deal as you’ll get from the other large providers too.

We believe this is wrong; home security should not only be for the privileged, everyone should have the possibility to protect what they hold most dear; their home and family.

This is why we started Alvira; to provide better protection against fires and break-ins to a fraction of the cost. To do this, we use cheap, but very reliable, sensors placed all around your home that detect both smoke and motion. If either is detected, residents instantly get notified through our app and can from there contact their closest neighbours. The neighbours who are home can then quickly, from a safe distance, investigate and alert the authorities.

Every year around 100 lives are lost in residential fires in Sweden alone, affecting thousands of families. As if those numbers aren't alarming enough, more than one in every 100 households will be victims of a break-in every year. That's 1 % of all Swedish homes, every year. 

With our custom designed sensor, intuitive app and connected neighbourhood watch we will introduce a new, better solution that everyone can afford. We hope that within five years Alvira is a natural part of every Swedish home, just like a home insurance is today.

Our target industry for now is ventilation systems so called as HVAC for office building. 
The product is a software solution that monitors and optimizes energy consumption of HVACs. But why HVACs? Ventilations are installed in almost all office and industrial buildings. Only in Denmark, 12 M m2 of area is dedicated to offices and buildings. This corresponds to a huge energy consumption by HVACs (about 40% of total electrical energy consumption of a building and funny enough buildings are responsible for almost half of energy consumption of Denmark in a year).
Despite of HVACs simplicity from system point of view, they are very complicated and confusing for the HVAC owners. The energy consumption and waste energy is not clear. Therefore, energy optimization becomes a long shot.
4i4’s product is solving these issues and brings values for the HVAC owners by peace of mind and valuable insight on how to optimize the energy and save on CO2 emission.

The Wilde Shop,Denmark,thewildeshop.com,2015,1-10,Retail,"B2C, Marketplace",Pre-seed,"HISTORY:
The idea came a year ago, after a few years of owning & running a successful women's designer vintage clothing store in Copenhagen. Observed how COVID19 affected consumer spending and surge in e-commerce. Inquiries about alternative payment solutions. Consistent increased sales, consumer excitement and interest focused on luxury branded bags.

THE BUSINESS IDEA IN A NUTSHELL:
Building a community-driven marketplace, facilitating buying and trading exclusive luxury designer bags, thus empowering members within a circular retail model, run by female entrepreneurs.

PROBLEM, SOLUTIONS AND VALUE CREATION:
People are looking for designer luxury bags, especially in Denmark. The consumer market for luxury bags is a 2.4 USD billion industry worldwide. However, current options for luxury bags can be expensive or “cheap”, low quality unverified or unqualified resellers. Alternatively, they are fakes or non-sustainable high street options. Sustainability awareness is forecast to increase in luxury fashion.
Furthermore, there is an increased preference to trusted brands. Through our platform, we give access to luxury! Our goal is to amplify an existing & growing community. Key to success will be inclusivity and access, giving all income group consumers across Denmark a platform to buy, rent, sell and trade their luxury items. Through paid membership tiers, we provide early access to events, sales, discounts and financial incentives. We provide consumers from different income brackets access to luxury items via new financial incentives eg. rental, monthly instalments and exchange initiatives

COVID has increased e-commerce spend. It has also decreased small brand sales and increased luxury brand focus. This change in mindset is accelerating the sustainable fashion trends. The market share for vintage and second hand industry has increased exponentially the last few years and expected to overtake consumer spending on new fashion in the next decade.
We want to offer an affordable solution - new ways of shopping, giving access to luxury products and building a digital community.

We are working with Norwegian real estate companies on developing a generative design tool for creating energy-efficient interior design solutions for offices. 

Today, this is done by technical personnel in a manual, slow and expensive process, due to the large amount of data sources and parameters that need to be considered. We want to modernize this process and provide innovative commercial real estate companies with an AI-driven generative design solution for quickly drawing up early-stage floor plans, cutting this process from weeks to just a few hours.

Sustainability in the real estate industry is a challenge which both The EU and the Norwegian government are constantly fighting to improve. Energy efficiency standards and environmental certifications contribute to greener office spaces, but fail to solve the issue of inefficient interior planning.

The core of the issue today is that all planning is done manually. By utilizing machine aided design, we want to allow offices to quickly generate several high-quality floor plans for any given building. This will ensure that office spaces can be healthy both for workers and the environment by cutting down on energy use. Additionally, this will give the tenants more than one floor plan to chose from and let them find their dream office in minutes as opposed to weeks.

Refillistic AB,Sweden,refillistic.com,2020,1-10,"Consumer Goods, Energy & Greentech, Service, Marketplace & eCommerce, Retail, Food & Beverage, Sales & Marketing, Robotics","B2C, B2B",Seed,"Business as usual gives consumers a linear consuming alternative: buy, consume, and eventually pollute the environment. Recycling is not enough and cheap either. Packages pollute the world since their existence. Since the 1950s, approximately 8.3 billion metric tons of plastics have been produced in the world. Mapped plastic flows in Sweden ONLY in 2016/2017 are import + production: 2,411,000 tons, PET bottles: 25,000 tons, packaging: 325,000 tons. Plastics production and the incineration of plastic waste give rise globally to approximately 400 million tons of CO2 a year. Globally, 5 to 13 million tons of plastics (1.5 to 4 % of global plastics production) end up in the oceans every year. Less than 30% of such waste is collected for recycling. There are 250 recycling stations in Stockholm and in 2019 recycling of packaging is a maximum of 44%. Detergent packaging price is between 0.30-0.80 US$. Package free shops aren't accessible and convenient enough.

Beside the plastic problems, consumers are looking for convenient shopping solutions. Food and grocery items delivery solutions such as Getir, Uber-eats, Delivery hero, etc... is a growing trend. But small amount delivery is not a environmental friendly solution.

Finally, corporates and companies like Unilever, P&G, Coca Cola, Heineken, Suez, ISS Global need to show that they have sustainable solutions. Partnering with refilling solution companies will give them prestige and they also will be part of the solution.

Convenient and sustainable shopping is possible.
We build refilling solutions like refilling robots, refilling trucks, and package free online grocer website to replace shopping with packages.

Start: Refillistic acts as the middle agent of FMCG such as detergent, pasta, disinfectant, flours, milk, ketchup etc. We will sell those consumer goods with a profit margin through our technological solutions as refilling robots in common/public areas (every 5th floor of a residential tower, common laundry rooms, etc.).

Our refilling robots and trucks will replace shopping single-use packaging at groceries, our business model will replace business as usual and reusing habits in consumers will replace recycling. Our disruptive method is eliminating the extra cost and the waste of single-use packaging.

When a consumer buys a product from Refillistic, It will create an positive impact on environment. Each refill will turn to a data about the reduction of single use plastic packages. This data will be shared with partner corporates and companies because they will be part of a convenient and sustainable solution. Refillistic shares the data and impact with them automatically, so they can share in their sustainability report or social media accounts as a proud partner. We expect consumers change their habit because the world is in climate crisis but waiting this takes so much time and effort. Let's give them a convenient shopping alternative by using technology in their green cities and use their resources which is single use plastic packages in sustainable way.

To us it’s a no brainer – every workplace should provide a safe, healthy and productive work environment. When you’re at work you may find yourself in vulnerable situations like working alone, in the dark, or during tough weather conditions you should never have to worry about “what if”.

Unfortunately there are many exposed professions like truck drivers, construction workers, road side assistance provoders and so on where accidents (sometimes fatal) happen. We believe some of these could be avoided with the use of smart technology.

We believe that by combining the ease of use (integrating the technology in the safety wearable you have to have anyway) there is nothing additional that the person need.

With integrated AI for fall detection as well as entry/exit of work vehicle detection, together with the connectivity and location mapping we can help making these professions safer. If something were to happen, alarms can be sent so that the person can get help.

Arctic Farming,Finland,arcticfarming.fi,2019,1-10,Agriculture,B2B,Seed,"We are Arctic Farming and our mission is to disrupt food production by making indoor farming mainstream. 

We believe that conventional farming is no longer sustainable. Shipping food around the world not only degrades product quality and nutritional values, but it also produces a significant amount of emissions. Why do this when technology allows us to farm fresh food 100% locally?

Our scalable, fully automated and IoT-based vertical farming modules can be used as individual systems in individual restaurants or retails stores, or as highly scalable industrial farms providing fresh produce directly to wholesale, restaurant or retail customers.

Each module is a fully automated and controlled ecosystem with smart technologies that optimise the amount of light, water and nutrients as well as a number of other variables. This enables the plants to grow faster, more efficiently and with the highest possible quality.

All of our farms are operated through a cloud-based farming software that gives us full control over the farms. Once you plug in the plants, automation takes over and the module will let you know when the produce is ready for harvest.

Using vertical farming technology, we are able to decouple farming from the environment. This enables us to produce the highest quality herbs and leafy greens anywhere at any time. And even better, while saving the environment one plant at a time.

EcoTree,Denmark,ecotree.green,2016,51-100,Energy & Greentech,Marketplace,Series A,"EcoTree is a green-tech company specializing in sustainability. Our goal is to promote environmental awareness and engage individuals and businesses in eco-friendly behaviour by offering simple, concrete, and financially viable solutions to becoming a tree or even forest owner.

Every single day 3.4 billion tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere worldwide. In Europe, we are among the worst polluters in the world. While we can do a lot to reduce our emissions, it is impossible to stay completely CO2 neutral. You can, in turn, offset your carbon footprint by planting trees. As a matter of fact, the forest is one of our best means to fight global warming, as trees absorb CO2 through the process of photosynthesis.  EcoTree has democratized and digitalized forestry. With EcoTree, it is easy and accessible both for individuals and businesses to contribute to the reforestation and preservation of our common green heritage. EcoTree enables everybody to become a tree owner. 

EcoTree has a team of forest experts that take care of planting and maintaining the forests in which your trees are located. You, being the owner of the trees, are entitled to receive 100% of the revenue generated from the wood sale when your trees have reached maturity, cut, and the forest is renewed. EcoTree implements a “close to nature” forestry management plan in which the preservation of the biodiversity in the forest is kept at the heart of our activities, and for every tree that is cut, EcoTree plants three new ones.

The idea behind EcoTree came up when a group of French childhood friends went to Copenhagen on a trip in 2014. There were many things that the group of friends adored about the Scandinavian lifestyle, but one thing that especially struck them was the well-functioning bottle deposit system. On each can, glass, or plastic bottle you purchase in Denmark you pay a small premium as a deposit that you get back when returning the empty bottles and cans to the supermarket. Consequently, the cities are clean and society more sustainable. This simple idea of rewarding sustainability led to the foundation of EcoTree. 

Approximately 600,000 newly planted trees later, the idea that was born in Scandinavia returns to its place of origin, as EcoTree has opened its new international office in Copenhagen in September 2019.

Some might call this sustainable, we think it's inevitable!
We need to grow more food to feed growing populations, and we need to do it in a way that does not destroy the planet in the process. 

But agriculture is a resource-heavy industry that depends on inputs such as water, seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, many of which are overused, just to be safe. This has an impact on the economy of the farmer, the quality of soil and water in our environment, and the quality of food that we eat. 
Food cannot grow without water and nutrients, and this is exactly where we focus our attention. 

At our core, we are a biochemical analysis company that combines Lab-on-a-Chip technologies, computer vision, and a modern software stack to produce a rapid testing device and analytics tools.  
But our product has gained the nickname “The blood test for crops”. 
This lets our customers rapidly measure the levels of chemicals in soil, water, or plant sap so they can make better decisions on how they use their chemical inputs. 
As you can imagine, it's a tech-heavy product but we strive to make it look simple so it can scale to even the most low-tech customers.

Culturally, we are diverse on all fronts. Gender, nationality, age, and academic background, to name a few. We believe that the modern workspace is a meeting of the minds and that collective intelligence is greater than the sum of the individuals.

We work with organic and recycled materials - and European factories that minimise their environmental footprint in order to create our underwear, activewear and everyday essentials in the best way possible.Our team consists of fabric geeks, environmental activists and everything in between.

Here’s the story. Three Danish school friends (Alexander Christiansen, COO. Mads Fibiger CEO and Christoffer Immanuel, CCO) didn’t like any of the underwear we wore - so we decided to make it better. No fashion school - no experience - no dots were connected and nobody said “ah, that makes sense”. But Organic Basics was born anyway. Back then we didn’t exactly think that sustainability was going to be at the centre of the fashion conversation today either - but we knew something was wrong with the industry. So we wanted to create a brand with purpose and meaning - to create something that we wanted towear ourselves. Sustainability had to be at the core of everything.That meant choosing environmentally friendly fabrics, partnering with responsible and transparent factories and designing products for longevity. Sustainability is always at the core - that’s what drives us to innovate and develop.

When a sports team or a school class is in need of funding for a team- or school trip, they often ask their parents for money. But that’s not a permanent solution to the issue. So, an industry for letting the kids sell products was born.

Today, this is a market of more than 500 MSEK across the Nordic countries (with Sweden being the biggest market, followed by Norway and Finland).

These youth teams and school classes are still selling products from big companies that have a focus on profits, and not on what’s best for the environment. Ingredients such as palm oil in thousands of products that are sold by school classes and sports clubs each year.

That’s where Kaffekassan steps in.

We want to make sure that the world gets what it deserves. That’s why we’re committed to build sustainable products for a sustainable future. Everything we do is with one goal in mind - make the products of this industry more sustainable. Our current product portfolio consists of a eco-certified ground coffee, a thermos bottle (perfect for stopping the use of one-time mugs), biodegradable coffee capsules, and more.

When we (the founders) still was in school and sold products to raise money for a school trip, we thought about how much the company’s products was destroying for the environment. And what’s more? They also kept a large majority of the profits instead of sharing it to our school class that was actually selling the products instead of using that profit to invest in making their service better and products more sustainable. 

This created a spark - a spark that have lit up and won’t stop until we’ve made a significant impact to our industry.   Location SwedenWebsite kaffekassan.seFounded 2015Employees 1-10Industries Consumer GoodsBusiness model B2BFunding state Bootstrapping",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

We are first-movers with global customers such as Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Mondelez, currently operating in Sweden and in USA.

62% of companies use spreadsheets to handle their climate data so the challenges are many and existing reporting tools only solve parts of them. Our software give businesses the capabilities to:
•	Start quick and easy with the data at hand and drill down in level of detail as the climate work develops.
•	Connect suppliers and partners to make data collection effortless. Each actor can see and report their business from their own point of view.
•	Simulate how different actions would impact emissions throughout the entire value chain. What happens to the carbon footprint if the onion/fabric/machine part is purchased from supplier X, rather than supplier Y? Or, How much emissions are avoided if we use electric vehicles in stead of diesel ones?
•	Collaborate throughout the value chain to reach common goals.

Our journey is at an early stage; we've just received initial funding, but in the future, we see ourselves as a global SaaS company, facilitating business collaboration to accelerate all the UN sustainable development goals. Our first focus, however, is Responsible Consumption and Production (12), Climate Action (13) and Partnership for the Goals (17).

Secondly, the plant-based alternatives to cheese that do exist on the market generally fall short on both taste and texture, providing little incentive for consumers to make climate friendly choices.

We have invented a low-cost technic that allows the content to exit from the packaging without allowing air to get in.

At Simple Feast, we believe that amazing things can happen around the dinner table. Our plant-based meal kits are rooted in our commitment to making life easier and better for you, your family, and the planet we all share.

Simple Feast takes you on a journey toward a future where the power and flavors of plants are the focus of our meals. Through inspiring and delightful taste experiences, we can help move people’s eating habits in a more sustainable direction.

Our story
Simple Feast was founded in Copenhagen (in 2014) with the vision of getting more Danes to make more meals at home. We wanted to go back to the primordial tradition of sharing food with family and friends.

We started by creating an app with hundreds of recipes from some of the world’s finest chefs. However, we soon recognized how many people today have limited time for cooking and the need for everyday meals that are quick and easy to prepare. So in March 2017, we decided to cook the food for you on the days you didn’t have time to do it yourself. 

We knew that the simple action of embracing a plant-based diet held the potential to be our generation’s greatest contribution to ourselves and our planet. Each week, our culinary team (composed of former Michelin chefs) designs an array of delicious, crowd pleasing meals that just so happen to be made of plants.

Simple Feast is B Corp™ certified
B Corp™ is an international certification standard that defines success on the basis of inclusive and sustainable economics. As a certified B Corp™ we meet the highest verified standards of transparency, responsibility, sustainability and performance – all with the aim of generating value for the business and for society as a whole.

Did you know?
Packaging for food and beverages are among the most common litter in towns and parks, as well as at beaches. 
Current recycling rates are poor (~8-9%) in Sweden and globally and 90% of the recycled plastics are exported to developing countries.

It's time for a change! 
PANTER offers a reusable lunch box and coffee cup for restaurants, cafés and catering. 

According to the Directive on single-use plastics (2019) all EU countries are required to ""Take measures to reduce the consumption of drinking cups including covers and lids, and containers for prepared food""
Which means that in Sweden:
Ban on disposable cups containing more than 10% plastic
Mandatory to offer the drink or food in a reusable cup or lunch box from 2024

The restaurants we have interviewed want to get started!
Why?
– Increased customer loyalty
– Brand that’s not associated with waste 
– Opportunity to promote sustainability 
-  Lower costs for packaging

Each bite begins with a crispy lightness followed by a wholesome, satisfying crunch, crafted in a selection of familiar flavors - done a little differently. 

The Why: 
By 2050, the world is required to produce at least 50% more food and do so while achieving 'Net Zero' carbon emission according to the UN. Seaweed has unique properties in that it can be grown on lines of rope in the ocean, with no requirement for artificial inputs (fertiliser, fresh water, light). The output is nutritious seaweed that is stock full of essential vitamins (A, D, E, B1, B2), Iron, Calcium, and Omega-3 fat - usually only found in fish. And there's more - seaweed also sequesters about 5x as much CO2 as land-based plants.

In short, seaweed can be part of the solution for some of the world's largest issues. 

Our dream, is to create local demand,  for locally produced seaweed, to support foods of the future and Danish companies.

Organisations can use the platform internally to map available materials in existing buildings and leftovers from building projects in a database for reuse in future construction projects. This will reduce carbon emissions as well as overall building costs.

In future, GreenStock will be offered as a digital marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of reclaimed materials to reduce waste in commercial and residential construction projects.

Concrete benefits
Streamlined management of building materials can reduce construction waste, while cutting the costs associated with wasting new materials.

GreenStock’s digital platform enables users to save materials, manage transport and storage, and gather documentation about the materials. It also provides data on the carbon reductions and financial savings generated through use of the platform.

Materials that can generally be recycled from construction sites include steel and concrete elements, aluminium, untreated timber, cardboard, paint and plastics. Leftover materials may include complete products, such as doors, windows, insulation, flooring and technical equipment.

Market potential
GreenStock has completed development of the beta version of the platform and is testing it together with building developers. A fully developed solution for a public marketplace will be available by the end of 2020.

By bridging the gap between Europe and China we enable the making of visionary products for ambitious people.

Traditionally, when developing a product for the market, you would engage several separate partners. It’s a costly and time-consuming process. Nymatech is different. We can take on the full scale of product development – from initial idea to market-ready product.

We eliminate the need for separate partners by managing all parts of the process. Our approach is structured in two phases: Build the plan and Build the product. 

Our process of product design, prototyping, building, testing and bridging the connection to local manufacturers up-front will get our clients products to market, fast.

Harmoniq audio is a tech start-up, founded in Dec 2018. Our goal is to innovate the way speakers are produced, used and recycled. We started this journey with a focus on the development of new, sustainable alternatives to speaker components, including insulation and cabinets.

At Harmoniq audio we are mainly working remotely, but we have a production facility 175m2 in Randers we are trying to setup with PNP machine and CNC machine, etc.  

Harmoniq audio was originally founded by Lasse Hald Andersen and Troels Mikkelsen. Lasse and Troels have known each other since kindergarten and their passion for making speakers started, like many others, with building speakers for the camp at Roskilde Festival and later for friends who needed to use festival speakers for their own camps.

Since then, Lasse contiuned the journey and has been educated as an electronics technologist and prof. Bachelor in innovation and entrepreneurship, and are now running the startup, while having a full time job on the side. 

The interest in speaker production has led to an insight into the speaker industry, which has formed one of Harmoniq audio's central goals: to develop sustainable speakers while creating as good Hi-Fi as possible.

money spent in pets has more than doubled within the last

Dogs are pampered with more and more stuff, and fed with

Hydrovertic,Denmark,hydrovertic.com,2020,1-10,Agriculture,B2B,Bootstrapping,"To ensure SME horticulture adapts, Hydrovertic develops a modular vertical
hydroponic farming system creating a sustainable.

Our modules will be able to keep small greenhouses competitive with the low labour cost countries, increase automation, production volume and work shifts in Denmark all while accommodating low investment opportunities. 
Traditionally vertical farming (VF) systems have static crops, meaning that the person needs to move around the system. This uses a lot of space, which could be used for production. Our crop flow makes the crops move from A to B, allowing multiple modules to stack next to each other and with a closed-loop in our modules, we boost space efficiency, scalability, minimizing resources and no uses of pesticides - differentiating ourselves from our competitors. 

Agriculture is one of the largest contributors to pollution. Having tried growing vegetables with the use of hydroponics ourselves, we decided to use our engineering skills to create a small vertical farming system with an industrial approach. We have established a small network of suppliers and acquired a facility in Rudme to start building and testing. Our Danish beachhead market consists of farmers who produce leafy greens in greenhouses and/or want to reorganize or expand their operations. 

According to figures from Dansk Gartneri, there are 94 farms with greenhouse operations in Denmark within our target segment, of which about 20 farms fall within our niche market of&gt;1500m2, the majority of which are located on Funen. We have chosen our specific market niche, as this segment can initially get the most out of our system. A priority for Hydrovertic is the diffusion of the system and keeping the initial investment costs low for farmers. Aiming to internationalise in Scandinavia and Finland. By aiming at co-creating and validating the system together with selected early adopters, e.g. Egeskov Slot and Yding Grønt, we get insight into how our systems will work in a real-life scenario. 

We have established connections with Dansk Gartneri and Food & Bio Cluster confirming the challenges and the lack of a small scalable vertical farming system for SMEs. Our direct competitors are Vergromat, Jones Food Company and Viemose DGS; they develop modular vertical farming systems. Our indirect competitors are Infarm, Next Food and Nordic Harvest who outsource much of their system setups but grow their own produce.

Lokalist,Denmark,lokalist.dk,2020,1-10,"Consumer Goods, Energy & Greentech, IT & Software, SaaS, Service","B2C, B2B",Pre-seed,"Who we are

Each year in Denmark, over 2 million people upgrade their smartphones, but few have a clear idea of what to do with their previous device. Of course, they could sell it or trade it in, but today these options are primarily perceived as a hassle, a scam, or a waste of time.

This results in Danes often having two or more smartphones wasting in a dusty drawer. Our mission to reduce this waste and to make the best use of their potential by providing a transparent, fair, and simple way to ensure that our old technology gets used to its fullest extent. The user can then support sustainable causes through our platform with the value of their used phones. 


Why do we exist?

Used phones are extremely valuable. In fact, every year we estimate that at least one billion kroner worth of used phones enters the market in Denmark alone. On top of this, smartphone production has tremendous environmental and social impacts that are seldom talked about. Making the best use of minerals and labor that has already been put into our phones is the least we can do. 

Through research, we found that most people do not sell or trade-in their devices today for various reasons. However, over 90% of people responded that they would donate the value that their used phone could be sold for, entirely or in part, to philanthropic causes so long as it was easy and transparent. Therefore, not only are the causes we support genuinely good, but they provide the motivation to awaken a large and growing market.

Today there is no platform where this can easily be done. Lokalist aims to fill this gap in the market and be the platform where people and businesses can easily donate all or part of the value of their used technology to support sustainable actions we all want to see more of. 


What happens to the used phones?

The used phones we receive are safely wiped, complying with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They then have a 92% chance to be refurbished or harvested for working components. The semi-new phones are sold in markets across the world to be loved by future users. The phones that cannot be refurbished are responsibly recycled, making sure to reuse minerals that are otherwise impactful to mine. 


Our values

As a company, we focus heavily on integrating the Nordic values of transparency, honesty, community, and simplicity into our mission. This is not typical of our competitors in this space.

By being active in the carrying-out of the sustainable causes with our partners, and showing our users instantly how their device could support them, we believe we can help make the best use of our e-waste while spreading the love.

Typically these products are filled into glass bottles, which have been shipped half way around the world from the bottle manufacturer to the bottling facility, to then again be shipped half way around the world to the end customer. The carbon footprint that this leaves behind is pretty scary.

Our alternative is not only significantly lighter and hence better for our Planet, it also has a positive impact on the shelf life of the product, helping to preserve its freshness and flavour and reduce food waste.

We've called this innovation the FullFlow package, a direct replacement to the glass bottle. The unique feature about FullFlow is that it can replace glass bottles as small as 250ml (in fact even smaller but we've decided to start with the most popular sizes first), without any negative impact on flow rate, flow pattern and product evacuation.

We've developed the FullFlow package in close cooperation with some of the most reputable olive oil manufacturers around the globe, and interest for the product has exceeded our expectations.

Lalatoys,Denmark,lalatoys.dk,2020,1-10,Marketplace & eCommerce,B2C,Bootstrapping,"Lalatoys is a new startup, building a sharing economy retail service for children’s toys. The concept is simple: you sign up and pick the toys you want to play with. Whenever the toy becomes needless for your child, send it back and get something else.

Billions of dollars are put into the children's toy market yearly, and of these, millions of unwanted toys are send to landfills every year. What is even worse is that a high amount of children's toys are produced from non-biodegradable plastic. By swapping instead of shopping, we can let our children play in a more eco-friendly way. 

We launched in Marts 2021 and spend more than a year to adapt and develop the concept to fit the market. Now we have had +1000 subscribers and expect to grow steady through the next year! Aside for daily operation and development of the platform and its features which is essential for us to be a scalable business.

The idea started, when I, Dinesan, became father for the first time last year. We bought a lot of toys for our daughter (and still do), but in the end it showed that most of the toys our daughter didn't play with after a very short period - it was quite frustrating that we spend money of something, we either would loose money on reselling and would pile up together with the rest.

Currently we are three people in the team:

Dinesan Rasiah (Founder - CEO)
Christian Nielsen Henriksen (Co-founder CTO)
Nicolai Varney (CMO)
Jannie Varaney (COO)

Since then, we have patented and developed a grip that provides farmers with the ability to identify (colors/ID), handle (grip) and maintain (rubber bellow) their hydraulic hoses/connections without wasting time on cleaning the couplings to prevent leaks.

Today, Hydrosafe is the only start-up developing smarter accessories for hydraulic connections on agricultural equipment and construction machinery. As fun and sexy as that might sound, we enjoy aiding farmers and workers all around the world with the ability to become sustainable and efficient in handling and maintaining their hydraulics.

The main problem we are solving concerns dust and other particles entering the hydraulic system through the hydraulic connection, causing malfunctions, leaks, downtime etc. Our product solves this at root cause as the dust can no longer reach the connection in the first place. 
It is designed and manufactured based on great demand from end customers, which is why we set sail to become the innovative suppliers behind smarter handling of hydraulic connections.

If you have no clue about the shape, sizes and functions of hydraulic connections, then do not worry. It is quite simple and we did not grow up as farmers. There will be no doubts after you have seen the product in action.

At Hydrosafe we are investing ourselves in a healthy and growing environment packed with dedication, honesty and joy. We support each other and work very close to assure:

✓ Flexibility in our worklife to enable ourselves to carry responsibility
✓ Customer-based innovation as a key mind-set and competitive advantage

Atomler is a greentech startup located in Sweden that is developing a B2B digital platform in order to increase the recycling rates of plastic material from post-industrial and ocean bound streams. Our vision is that there should be no need for landfills in the world.

The What
Challenge(s) for increasing trade with recyclable materials are...
- Transparency of price is important for companies buying recycled materials
- Trust between market actors is mainly created in offline meetings
- Material quality is often uncertain when buying recycled materials
- Speed is often lacking in finding the right recycled material in sufficient quantity

The How
Atomler's solution:
- Transparency and material quality - find material, see pricing and download material quality certificates instantly
- Transparency and trust - communicate with your buyers and suppliers prior to settling the deals
- Speed - access atomler.com anytime, anywhere using your phone, tablet or computer

The Why
We met working at a large second hand C2C website, realising there's a problem on the B2B side that needs to be solved. Our long term vision is to get rid of all the worlds landfills (including misplaced rubbish in the nature). A milestone is to speed up EU's goal of increasing the rate of using recycled plastics by supplying a tool to companies that solves the problems around buying and selling recyclable and leftover plastics.

There are 2 connected problems that we solve. They originate from the fact that financial institutions are required to adhere to strict regulations when onboarding clients. 
This makes the onboarding journey of a client slow and onerous, and causes many clients to abandon the onboarding process. We call this problem the ""Consumer Compliance Conflict"". 
The second problem is that this regulation also makes client onboarding complicated, costly, and prone to human error - and for that reason, many financial institutions simply don't comply, leaving investors and society open to fraud etc. 
We call this problem the ""Cost of Compliance"". 

We solved these two problems by automating the entire client onboarding journey. This makes the process fast and smooth for the client; and also a lot less expensive and complicated for the financial institution - and therefore the level of compliance, and as a result the levels of investor and society protection, significantly increase. 

It's a win-win-win situation. The investors get more protection; financial institutions get more protection and lower costs; and even compliance officers, which at first fear their jobs are endangered by automation, find out it only takes away the repetitive, error-prone parts, and frees them to do the more interesting parts of their role.

Vildora,Sweden,vildora.se,2020,1-10,"Marketplace & eCommerce, Food & Beverage","B2C, Marketplace",Seed,"Vildora started with one clear purpose: inspire consumers to substitute beef for game meat in everyday life  & delivering it to your doorstep.

After years of increased consumption of vegetarian food we felt that we wanted to cut out the industry meat from our diet totally, obviously due to health and moral reasons. 

At the same time we found out that there is an huge ""over production"" of venison/game meat in Sweden due to hunting. Game meat in general has ZERO-climate impact when ""produced"" in comparison to beef that according to UN is responsible for over 18% of all greenhouse gases in the world. 

Utilizing these resources to distribute healthy protein to people that couldn't get hold of it in the local supermarket was the birth of Vildora. The idea crystalized even more with all the home deliveries during the pandemic so the solution became obvious: 

""Get premium quality meat from hunters to your doorstep""

We are now taking this even further by including 40+ local producers in different food categories, expanding our product offering in the processes of delivering sustainable food to your doorstep. Everything done with the purpose that lowers the environmental impact. 

The near future of Vildora is to become the biggest online grocery store for environmentally aware consumers in Sweden and in Europe.

ENDA,Sweden,enda.se,2022,1-10,"Marketplace & eCommerce, Fashion & Living","B2B, Marketplace",Bootstrapping,"ENDA is currently building a digital platform to streamline and simplify the process of shopping for eco-friendly clothes online. The aim is to lower the demand for ''Fast Fashion'' and raise the demand for ''Slow Fashion'' + ''Sustainable Fashion'' in the clothing industry.

Today, we believe that shopping for clothes online is impersonal, inefficient and unsustainable.

Impersonal in the sense that the wide range is not for everyone and there is no direct filtering system sufficiently developed to suit the individual. For example, you have to browse through lots of clothes you don't like before you find what you really want.

Inefficient to the extent that the large supply is scattered across multiple online retailers. For example, you need to compare the price, stock status and delivery time of various online shops. This means that the process of shopping for clothes online can be both unproductive and time-consuming.

Unsustainable to the extent that many of the major fashion companies offer and refer mostly to ''Fast Fashion''. Which means that constant novelties are promoted with clothes that have compromised quality at squeezed prices.

This has contributed to the fashion industry being one of the third largest industries that are polluting our planet today. Below are some examples of areas where fast fashion is having a negative impact.

- Textile waste
- Eradication of raw materials
- Water use and pollution
- Microfibers in the sea
- Carbon emissions
- Fossil fuels
- Agriculture
- Deforestation
- Sweatshops
- Public health hazard
- Exploitative labor practices
- Child Labor
- Forced labor
- Insane work hours

The above areas are something we care about, hence something worth fighting for.

We are trying to build a digital platform that enables for personal, efficient and eco-friendly shopping online. 

Personal in the sense that there is a personalized filtering system for all products that are offered.

Efficient to the extent that multiple online retailers are available in one place.

Eco-friendly to the extent that we offer and guide the individual to make more sustainable purchases.

By offering information to the consumer about what is eco-friendly plus allowing them to shop in a convenient way, we believe this is a step towards a more sustainable way of shopping on the internet.

Both of us, (Eric & Filip) have always been entrepreneurial. We come from families with entrepreneurs and have both driven our own businesses before. We have always wanted to do or make something that has a positive impact on the world and its environment. To leave this world in a better shape than we found it, and that's where the idea started to take form. With the world becoming more digitalized by everyday that goes by, and online purchasing becoming more common the shopping in an actual shops (especially during the pandemic). We came to the conclusion that shopping clothes online is extremely wearying. And with fast fashion brands taking over social media and spreading like wildfire. We thought to ourselves, “How can we make shopping more fun and painless and at the same time persuade and educate people to shop more environmentally friendly.

We have all seen what impact climate change has to the world and it would be a shame not to try and rework the damages we have caused with the time that is given to us.

We at Leafymade plans to target this problem by providing alternative sustainable solutions.

The How
Our idea is to use natural, biodegradable materials to make sustainable disposable products that can go as an organic waste after its use. This means Leafymade products leaves nothing behind. For example our tableware like  disposable plates, bowls, dip bowls etc are made up of leaves and only leaves. Our product are the perfect alternate of one time disposable plates made of paper and plastics. Our products are suatainable and goes back into the nature in only 2-3 weeks without leaving any footprints on the environment. No chemical and pesticides are used in the process. It also give the impression of the step towards the sustainable future.

Similarly, our another product is pots for cultivation that are made up of coconut fiber. We observed that all herbs like basil and coriander in Sweden comes in disposable plastic pots and so we developed a product that can replace them.
In future, we want to develop more products.

The Why
A thought experiment when we traveled back in time, before the invention of paper and plastics. Humans still used disposable but they were all made of natural materials and sustainable. Then even today, there is a common practice in south Asia, where people use fresh banana leafs as disposables. So these idea lead to the existence of Leafymade project.

Jordisk,Norway,jordisk.no,2020,1-10,"Consumer Goods, Marketplace & eCommerce, Food & Beverage","B2B, Marketplace",Bootstrapping,"Jordisk (""Earthly"" in Norwegian) is a start-up based in Norway that is developing a unique distribution platform for sustainable packaging to help businesses which need single-use food packaging to become environmentally friendly by embracing products which are recyclable, compostable and/or biodegradable.

We are also a part of the accelerator Fauna: https://www.faunaeksperimentet.no/

There is an immediate need to replace traditional single use packaging that is normally based on fossil based plastics with more sustainable alternatives that already exist in the market. Food packaging is becoming a growing global concern, because of the large amount of waste it generates and the chemicals it contains that can be detrimental to our health.

In 2014, out of the 258 million tons of municipal solid waste generated in the US, more than 63 percent was of packaging materials (for food and other purposes) and, overall, only 35 percent (89 million tons) was recycled or composted. What happens to the remaining 65 percent? We all know that landfills are frequently used and that a lot of waste is just burned which leaves a huge carbon footprint. The end of life alternative for food packaging can be significantly improved by using alternative eco-friendly materials that already exist and can be implemented in a circular model.

The aim of our distribution platform is to be the natural marketplace for sellers of sustainable food packaging where they can showcase their products to potential buyers who need one time packaging. Moreover, ideal sellers would genuinely care about the environment and have a circular model in order to reduce the carbon footprint as much as possible. A typical customer would be a restaurant that offers takeaway. The food packaging industry operates in a very traditional way with one-to-one contracts and is mature enough for a disruption. With our platform, we can be the link and matchmaker between the supplier and customer. Our goal is to raise awareness in the industry and among consumers, so they can know about sustainable food packaging alternatives such as products that are made of bagasse, bamboo, mycelium, leaves, bio-laminat and plant-based plastic such as PLA.

The timing is ideal, as we are currently seeing drastic changes in jurisdiction and lawmaking in Europe, single-use plastic cutlery, cotton buds, straws and stirrers will be banned by 2021 and the EU's Green Deal Strategy is to find sustainable alternatives to replace traditional fossil based plastic.

We are currently doing market research in Norway in order to source and partner with producers that could be interested in our platform. The feedback we are getting so far are positive, as most new producers would like further traction in order to get much needed market share. We are actively looking for another person with the technical know-how that wants to join the team to develop this platform with us.

Even though we live in an era of Instagram and Facebook where spreading awareness in a particular topic is easier than before, environmental pollution is still one of the most concerning issues in today’s world. We, as consumers, are either too busy to care about packaging, or there aren’t many sustainable options to choose from when buying a product.

One of the founders, Rezowan, has a background from the travel industry, and has from many of his previous travels seen the growing amount of plastic going astray, both on land and at sea. In many Asian countries, he has seen that there are no good waste solutions that contribute to, for example, plastic being recycled in a circular way. Over the last 2-3 years, new technology has been developed that makes it easier to choose sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives, and the main goal is to promote environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil plastics so that society can become more aware of this.

It enables players to play with better balls for as much as 5 times longer, improving the game, making it more affordable, and reduces plastic & rubber waste from tennis & padel balls. 
 
Why this matters? After only one hour of play, 20% of the pressure in tennis & padel balls disappears - starting when you open the can the balls are bought in. Because of this, hobby players are forced to buy new balls about every 2 times they play. At a higher level, balls are changed multiple times in a single match. This is completely unnecessary - since all the materials in the balls are in  great condition for many hours of play.

Of the balls thrashed, only 2% are recycled. The rest of the toxic waste ends up in places such as landfills, or in our oceans. The balls that ends up in nature stays there for 400 years before they break down. This makes tennis and padel two of the dirtiest (and most expensive) sports!

Basis Nuts,Denmark,basisnuts.com,2020,1-10,"Agriculture, Food & Beverage",B2C,Pre-seed,"Basis Nuts finds and imports unique, delicious, regional varieties of nuts grown by small-scale farmers.

Today, consumers are nut illiterate in the same way we were coffee illiterate 20 years ago. We're unable to identify different nut varieties, recognize the different tastes between varieties, or distinguish between the same nut grown in different growing areas. Without this basic understanding of nuts, consumers are unable to judge the quality of nuts and thus buy them based on price.

This has benefited the nut industry enormously, because it has made nuts completely interchangeable. It means that nut buyers and importers can source nuts from around the world and dictate the prices for growers – even if it is below the cost of production. It means that in order to be competitive, nut growers have to plant larger and larger orchards, mechanize their production, and grow high-yielding nut varieties to ensure that they can sell their nuts on the international market. It means that local, traditional nut varieties are less and less available as the industry favors standardization.

We've also lost one of the most important things: taste. In the industry's push for disease resistance, durability, and standardization, we've lost flavors, textures, and variety.

Basis Nuts is trying to change this. We find the best-tasting varieties of nuts that are grown by small farmers around the world and import them to Denmark. We identify the variety, origin, and uniqueness about these nuts and target food-conscious consumers and chefs to make them realize what they've been missing. We want to highlight and preserve biodiversity and make people start to think about where their nuts come from.

Each of us is responsible for climate change through our way of life. In particular, Co2 emissions are affected by what we eat, how we transport ourselves, where we live, and the products we buy.
 
Most of us are aware there are consequences of those lifestyle choices. However, the consequences of each of our individual lifestyle choices are not fully transparent or easy to measure. 

We know we should reduce air travel, but we do not know the exact consequence / Co2 footprint of a weekend trip to Barcelona, the impact of becoming vegetarian or flexitarian, or getting an electric car instead of an ICE car.

ColouReef,Denmark,coloureef.com,2020,1-10,"Consumer Goods, Service, Retail, Fashion & Living","B2C, B2B",Bootstrapping,"We are a new social startup named ColouReef and we are going to rethink and innovate the fashion industry. As you probably know, the fast fashion industry has a more negative impact on our environment and society than it does good. Being one of the most polluting ones, the industry emits more CO2 into the atmosphere than international flights and maritime shipping combined. Moreover, it is a water-consuming giant that is responsible for 20% of all industrial water pollution worldwide. Additionally, fast-fashion companies that produce garments in the global south, are profiting by exploiting local labour and nature.

Fast fashion is the problem. Ever changing trends, consumerism and the fear of being left out, affects people psychologically, as fashion collections’ frequency jumped from 2 to 4 per year in 2000 to 12, 16 and sometimes 24 different collections per year in 2019. As a result, in 2014 to compare with 2000, on average people bought 60% more clothes and kept them just half as long. Consequently, this behaviour created another major problem of the industry – waste. Around 85% of the textile ends up in landfills or being burned, while barely 15% are recycled. In 2017 – 16.9 million tons of textile was produced, and only 2,6 million tons were recycled. The problem is, that many consumers in the global North are being held as hostages by the fast fashion trends, without many, if any, sustainable alternatives.
This is our solution to the problems above:

• To create a fashion rental service based on a circular economy, that allows customers to own different garments by paying a monthly subscription. In this way we will be able to reduce the impact of the fast fashion while allowing people an opportunity to change their outfit and style more often.

• We will offer clothes ONLY from sustainable companies, which care about our planet and everyone living on it. Meaning that clothes will need to be produced sustainably and ecologically and/or contain recycled fabrics, as well as not to exploit labour within their supply chain.

• Damaged and worn out clothes will be returned back to the clothing brand to upcycle or will be recycled and/or upcycled locally by ColouReef. This way we will fight together the problem of enormous waste caused by the industry.

• We will change the habits of the consumers, by providing an alternative to own and wear sustainable clothing for a period of time instead of owning cheap and vastly produced fashion garments. At the same time, we will educate our customers about the damages that the textile industry is doing to our environment.

• As the name of our company implies, we want to help to protect coral reefs that are on the verge of extinction. Coral reefs are a vital part of the whole underwater ecosystem. Warming ocean and ocean acidification are two of the main reasons why corals are bleaching and dying around the world. Besides our effort to transform the fashion industry into a more sustainable version of it, we will also support selected NGOs that are fighting against coral extinction.

We are looking for people thinking in the same way, seeing the problems and wanting to solve them by disrupting the fashion industry. If you are interested and would like to know more, contact us on info@coloureef.com

Liner shippers are challenged by extremely complex stowage rules of container vessels. This means that sales teams are unable to fill all slots and sell container bookings that fit the vessel. The problem is known, but has defied automation until today. 

CAPSIM is the fourth generation of a series stowage algorithms developed in collaboration with Danish Universities since 2007. It includes a patented AI technology for predicting lashing forces and forecasting cargo. It is the first stowage algorithm in the world that is able to select spot and contract cargo to stow on a vessel that maximizes total cargo yield.  

A PoC with a large Danish liner shipper showed that CAPSIM enables vessels to increase their profit with 5-8%. This is a breakthrough result in a market that normally has profit margins of a few percent. The potential extra profit of the world fleet is more than $10B per year.

In other cases we are more of an alternative, for example to tenant farmers who face extra difficulties getting funding from traditional lenders. 
The core investment strategy is to fund investments which help the farmer reduce financial risk while supporting development goals such as increased carbon capture in soil, improved biodiversity and reduced nutrient run-off. 
Regenerative farming holds great potential to sequester atmospheric carbon, promote biodiversity, and produce healthy food. We aim to accelerate this regenerative transition by enabling farmers to realize their investments and improve their financial and environmental performance.

Wonsta,Finland,wonsta.io,2021,1-10,"IT & Software, SaaS, Marketplace & eCommerce, Sales & Marketing",B2B,Pre-seed,"The automated way to grow your website business. 

Wonsta is a managed WordPress hosting platform, where freelancers have the access to a variety of tools, to make their business even more profitable and smarter: client billing, client reports, website bulk management, and automation features to boost their business. Wonsta is by far the easiest way to manage your website portfolio.

We offer a super-easy way to create new WordPress websites even more efficiently. Just create a client, pick a template and start to build a new project. All done in our blazing-fast Google Cloud-powered modern hosting infrastructure. After the project is done, you can set your own rules that Wonsta will run for you: update plugins on Friday, send invoices every 30th, send management reports every week, etc.

The reason why Wonsta exists is that we were tired of losing money, our health, and nerves to endless swamp regarding website portfolio management: currently when you grow as a freelancer or as an agency, you're just praying that all previously created websites stay up and they work with a minimum level of maintenance. But that's not the case, because there will always be updates, reports, invoices, and various fixes that you need to act on.
